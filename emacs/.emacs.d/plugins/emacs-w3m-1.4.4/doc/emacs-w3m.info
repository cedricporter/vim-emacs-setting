Preliminary remarks
*******************

Emacs/W3 (http://www.cs.indiana.edu/elisp/w3/docs.html) once was the
most popular web browser on Emacs.  However, it worked so slowly that
we wanted a speedy alternative.  On the other hand, w3m
(http://w3m.sourceforge.net/) was a pager with WWW capability,
developed by Akinori ITO.  Although it was a pager, it was possible to
use it as a text-mode WWW browser, so we started developing an Emacs
interface to w3m.

Our special thanks go to Akinori ITO and the w3m team for the
excellent w3m program.  We would also like to thank everybody who has
submitted comments, suggestions, and bug fixes.  Even though we're not
aware of any problems, all responsibility for this program is ours
(the emacs-w3m development team), but there is absolutely no warranty.
The emacs-w3m program was first created by TSUCHIYA Masatoshi in June
2000.

It's so easy to begin to use emacs-w3m
**************************************

Emacs-w3m may have already been installed on your system, in which
case you can skip this section and begin to use the program at once.
If you're not that lucky, read on to learn how to install emacs-w3m.

File: emacs-w3m.info, Node: Required Emacs Version, Next: You Need w3m, Prev: Getting Started, Up: Getting Started

What version of Emacs can be used?
==================================

You can run emacs-w3m in various versions of Emacsen listed below:


`Emacs 21.x'
     No additional packages are required.

`Emacs 22.x'
     No additional packages are required.  If you're using a
     prerelease version of Emacs 22 (such as versions 21.3.50 or
     22.0), make sure it is newer than March 2004.

`XEmacs 21.x'
     The APEL package and the `gifsicle' program are required (*Note
     Other Requirements::).  We recommend using the latest XEmacs 21.4
     which seems stable.

`Emacs 20.x'
     No additional package is required.  Furthermore, you can see
     monochrome bitmap images inline by using the BITMAP-MULE package
     (*Note Other Requirements::).

`Emacs 19.34 (including Mule 2.3)'
     The APEL package, the `new custom' package and the
     `regexp-opt.el' module are required.  If you are using Mule 2.3
     based on Emacs 19.34, you can see monochrome bitmap images inline
     by using the BITMAP-MULE package (*Note Other Requirements::).

Using w3m: the reason why emacs-w3m is fast
===========================================

Emacs-w3m uses the external w3m program as a back-end to retrieve web
contents and as an HTML rendering engine; that's how we could create
an accelerated Emacs web browser with asynchronous operation.

You must install the latest w3m, it is available at:

`http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/w3m/'



File: emacs-w3m.info, Node: Other Requirements, Next: Installing Emacs-w3m, Prev: You Need w3m, Up: Getting Started

Things required to run emacs-w3m
================================

Depending on the version of Emacs, third party packages may be
required.  This section provides resources to help you find and
install them.


`APEL'
     Indispensable to XEmacs, Emacs 19.34 or Mule 2.3.  You should
     install APEL before building emacs-w3m.  APEL is available at:

     `ftp://ftp.m17n.org/pub/mule/apel/apel-10.6.tar.gz'

     Note that you must not use the APEL XEmacs package (which is
     contained in SUMO).  If you have already installed the APEL
     XEmacs package, use the following directives to replace it with
     APEL which is linked above (you can also use the same directives
     in order to newly install APEL):

          % rm -fr /usr/local/lib/xemacs/xemacs-packages/lisp/apel
          % cd apel-10.6
          % make install-package XEMACS=xemacs-21.4.x\
            PACKAGEDIR=/usr/local/lib/xemacs/xemacs-packages

`gifsicle'
     Indispensable to XEmacs.  There is a known bug in all XEmacs 21.x
     series that won't let it display optimized animated gifs
     correctly or may make it crash when some kind of an interlaced
     gif image is displayed.  Emacs-w3m uses the `gifsicle' program to
     convert gif data in order to make it possible to be handled by
     XEmacs 21.x.  It is available at:

     `http://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle/'

`ImageMagick'
     If the `convert' program bundled with the ImageMagick package is
     available on your system, emacs-w3m will use it to resize images
     or to convert `favicon' images into a format Emacs can handle.
     Emacs-w3m will work without ImageMagick, but installing it will
     improve your surfing experience.  You can get the ImageMagick
     package from:

     `ftp://ftp.imagemagick.org/pub/ImageMagick/'

     To manipulate `favicon' images, we recommend version 5.4.0-5 and
     later, previous versions may work but we didn't check them
     thoroughly.

`BITMAP-MULE'
     Used to display monochrome bitmap images inline in Emacs 20.x or
     Mule 2.3 based on Emacs 19.34.  It isn't necessary if you aren't
     interested in images.  It is available at:

     `ftp://ftp.jpl.org/pub/elisp/bitmap/'

`new custom'
     Indispensable to Emacs 19.34 (including Mule 2.3).  The `custom'
     library bundled with Emacs 19.34 is too *old*, its API is
     incompatible with the `new custom' bundled with recent Emacsen.
     The `new custom' for Emacs 19.34 is available at:

     `ftp://ftp.dina.kvl.dk/pub/Staff/Per.Abrahamsen/custom/custom-1.9962.tar.gz'

     Note that Mule 2.3 users should slightly modify it by applying
     the following patch:

          ----8<------8<------8<------8<------8<------8<------8<------8<----

`regexp-opt.el'
     Indispensable to Emacs 19.34 (including Mule 2.3).  The
     `regexp-opt.el' file is included in the `attic/' directory of
     the emacs-w3m distribution.  You may simply copy it somewhere (e.g.
     `site-lisp/' directory) and perform byte-compilation as follows:

          # cp -p attic/regexp-opt.el /usr/local/share/emacs/19.34/site-lisp
          # cd /usr/local/share/emacs/19.34/site-lisp
          # emacs -batch -q -no-site-file -f batch-byte-compile regexp-opt.el

`FLIM'
     The FLIM package is required to use the `shimbun' library.  The
     `shimbun' library is a collection of tools for reading web
     newspapers, you can use it with Gnus, Mew, Nana-gnus, T-gnus,
     Wanderlust, etc. *Note Shimbun Library::.

     Note that the FLIM package requires the APEL package even if you
     are using Emacs 20.x, Emacs 21.x or Emacs 22.x.  Therefore, you
     must install both APEL and FLIM if you would like to use the
     `shimbun' library.  The FLIM package is available at:

     `ftp://ftp.m17n.org/pub/mule/flim/flim-1.14/'

`xml.el'
     This file is required to use `shimbun' modules designed for sites
     which provide update information with RSS format.  Because it is
     distributed with Emacs 21 and later, you do not need to install
     it if you use Emacs 21 or later.  Otherwise, you may simply copy
     it somewhere (e.g. the Emacs `site-lisp/' directory) and perform
     byte-compilation as follows:

          # cp -p attic/xml.el /usr/local/share/emacs/20.7/site-lisp
          # cd /usr/local/share/emacs/20.7/site-lisp
          # emacs -batch -q -no-site-file -f batch-byte-compile xml.el

     If you use Emacs 19.34 (including Mule 2.3), additional options
     are required for byte-compilation as follows:

          # emacs -batch -eval '(put (quote char-after) (quote byte-compile) nil)' -f batch-byte-compile xml.el

`Mule-UCS'
     The Mule-UCS Emacs Lisp package makes your Emacs handle the
     Unicode system.  We recommend you install this package so that
     emacs-w3m can display pages written in UTF-8, etc.  It is
     available at:

     `ftp://ftp.m17n.org/pub/mule/Mule-UCS/Mule-UCS-0.84.tar.gz'

     When Mule-UCS is installed for Emacs-21.2, it is necessary to
     apply this patch
     (http://tsukuba.m17n.org/mule-archive/2002-3/msg00000.html)
     before installation.

     If you are an XEmacs user, the compiled package is here:

     `ftp://ftp.xemacs.org/packages/mule-ucs-1.04-pkg.tar.gz'



File: emacs-w3m.info, Node: Installing Emacs-w3m, Next: Non-UNIX-like systems, Prev: Other Requirements, Up: Getting Started

Installing emacs-w3m
====================

See the official page `http://emacs-w3m.namazu.org/' for instructions
on how to get the latest emacs-w3m.  Is everything ready?  Now, let's
begin.

In order to install emacs-w3m on non-UNIX-like systems (or any system
lacking the ability to execute the `configure' script or has no
`make' command), skip this section and go to the next section
*Note Non-UNIX-like systems::.

  1. First, extract a tarball of the emacs-w3m distribution and enter
     the top directory as follows:

          % tar zxf emacs-w3m-.tar.gz
          % cd emacs-w3m-

     If you've checked out emacs-w3m from CVS, you have to run
     `autoconf' with no argument to generate the `configure' script.

  2. Run the `configure' script.

          % ./configure

     *Important notice to Gnus users*:

     If multiple versions of Gnus are installed on your system (it is
     likely that there are the released version and the development
     version of Gnus), make sure that the `load-path' contains the
     directory where the version you use is installed (check for the
     `gnus.elc' file).  You can ensure that with the `--with-addpath'
     option as follows:

          % ./configure --with-addpath=/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/gnus

     If you've installed APEL, FLIM or something in non-standard
     directories other than the default `load-path', you must specify
     them using the `--with-addpath' option as follows (you may also
     include the Gnus directory in it separated with `:'):

          % ./configure --with-addpath=/opt/share/apel:/opt/share/flim

  3. Just run `make' and `make install'.  See also the next step if
     you are using XEmacs.

          % make
          % make install

     All Lisp and info files will be installed in the appropriate
     directories.  Now, how do you know what files will go where?  To
     know it beforehand, use this:

          % make what-where

     If you are using Emacs 21, 22 or XEmacs, you had better install
     icon image files.  To do this:

          % make install-icons

     or

          % make install-icons30

     The later is for using the slightly larger icon images.

  4. You can also install emacs-w3m as an XEmacs package using `make
     install-package' instead of `make install' as follows:

          % make
          % make install-package

     In this case, you don't have to execute `make install-icons' nor
     `make install-icons30'.

     If you need to specify the package directory, there are two ways
     to do that:


        * Use the `configure' option `--with-packagedir='.  For
          example:

               % ./configure --with-packagedir=/opt/xemacs/xemacs-packages
               % make what-where
               % make
               % make install-package

        * Use the `PACKAGEDIR' variable.  For example:

               % ./configure
               % make what-where PACKAGEDIR=/opt/xemacs/xemacs-packages
               % make
               % make install-package PACKAGEDIR=/opt/xemacs/xemacs-packages





File: emacs-w3m.info, Node: Non-UNIX-like systems, Next: Minimal Settings, Prev: Installing Emacs-w3m, Up: Getting Started

Installing on non-UNIX-like systems
===================================

If you cannot execute the `configure' script on your system, or if no
`make' command is available, cast the following spell:

     % emacs -batch -q -no-site-file -l w3mhack.el NONE -f w3mhack-nonunix-install

If APEL, FLIM (or any other library) aren't installed in the ordinary
places, the installer will leave them out.  In such a case, it is
necessary to tell those places to the installer as shown below:

     % emacs -batch -q -no-site-file -l w3mhack.el //c/share/apel://c/share/flim -f w3mhack-nonunix-install



File: emacs-w3m.info, Node: Minimal Settings, Prev: Non-UNIX-like systems, Up: Getting Started

Minimal settings to run emacs-w3m
=================================

This section mentions some fundamental settings for emacs-w3m.  If you
want to fine-tune your installation, you'll find many customizable
variables in *Note Customizable Variables::.


`Autoloads'

     You don't need this if you've installed emacs-w3m as an XEmacs
     package (*Note Installing Emacs-w3m::) because the
     `w3m/auto-autoloads.el' takes care of setting up autoloads.

     In all other cases, put the following line in your `~/.emacs'
     file:

          (require 'w3m-load)

`Startup File'

     We recommend using the `~/.emacs-w3m' file (which is the default
     value of `w3m-init-file') if you need to twiddle some emacs-w3m
     variables.  This file is similar to `~/.emacs', but is read when
     emacs-w3m starts.  Note that some options shouldn't be modified
     there, for example, `w3m-command'.

`Proxy Gateway'

     If you are behind a firewall and access the Internet through a
     proxy gateway, you need to instruct w3m to use it.

     There are several ways to do this, one is to set the `http_proxy'
     environment variable globally in the shell something like:

          setenv http_proxy http://proxy.hogege.com:8000/

     Another way is to customize the `w3m-command-arguments' variable to
     add the options `-o' and
     `http_proxy=http://PROXY_SERVER_NAME:PORT/'.

     This can also be done in your `~/.emacs-w3m' file as shown below:

          (setq w3m-command-arguments
                (nconc w3m-command-arguments
                       '("-o" "http_proxy=http://proxy.hogege.com:8000/")))

     To specify hosts for which the proxy shouldn't be used (Intranet
     sites and the like), set the `no_proxy' (note that it is not
     `no-proxy') environment variable to a comma-separated list of
     hostnames.  Alternatively, you can set the `w3m-no-proxy-domains'
     variable to a list of domain names (not host names) as follows:

          (setq w3m-no-proxy-domains '("local.com" "neighbor.com"))

     See also the documentation of the `w3m-command-arguments-alist'

Go ahead, just try it
---------------------

You can invoke emacs-w3m using three different commands, listed below.
Try one of these commands: a web page is displayed in an Emacs buffer
named "*w3m*", meaning that it is an emacs-w3m buffer.  As you will
probably notice, the major mode for an emacs-w3m buffer is `w3m-mode',
there are also minor modes (*Note Managing Bookmarks::).

This section explains the most fundamental usage of these commands,
see *Note Emacs-w3m Functions:: for more information on them.  See
also *Note Customizable Variables:: for variables you can use to
customize emacs-w3m's behavior.

`w3m'
     Start emacs-w3m, displaying the homepage specified in the
     `w3m-home-page' variable.  The default value for `w3m-home-page'
     is "about:".  Set the `w3m-quick-start' variable to `nil' if you
     want to input a target URL every time you start emacs-w3m.

     You can also use this as an Emacs batch command.  Here's an
     example:

          % emacs -f w3m

     To specify a URL, you could also use:

          % emacs -f w3m http://emacs-w3m.namazu.org/

`w3m-find-file'
     Prompt for a local file name in the minibuffer, and display it in
     emacs-w3m.

`w3m-browse-url'
     Prompt for a URL in the minibuffer, and display it in emacs-w3m.
     This command is provided, if anything, in order to start
     emacs-w3m from other application programs.

Moving in an emacs-w3m buffer won't be painful if you're an Emacs user
already, since many of the standard keys work as intended.  For
instance, `C-n', `C-v' and `C-s' (which are commonly used to move down
one line, one page, or search downwards for a word) are valid keys in
an emacs-w3m buffer.

To follow a link, use the `RET' key.  You have to move the point to a
link to do this; links are easily recognizable in a buffer because
they are not displayed like ordinary text: they can be underlined, or
have a different color.  The face `w3m-anchor-face' controls how they
are to be displayed (*Note Customizable Variables::).

`RET'
     Display the page pointed by the link under point
     (`w3m-view-this-url').

     The exact behavior of this command depends on the properties of the link
     under point, and on whether you give it a prefix argument or not.  See
     *Note Emacs-w3m Functions:: for details.

As mentioned above, you can be prompted for a URL when you use the
command `M-x w3m', by setting the `w3m-quick-start' variable to `nil'.
In an emacs-w3m buffer, there are also two popular ways to go to new
pages by entering their URLs, see below.

`RET'
     In an emacs-w3m buffer, you can be prompted for a URL in the minibuffer
     and make emacs-w3m display the corresponding page by hitting RET
     after moving the point to the URL displayed in the `header-line'.
     This feature will feel familiar to you if you are used to GUI-based web
     browsers like Mozilla.  Detailed explanations about this can be found in
     *Note Emacs-w3m Functions:: (`w3m-view-this-url').

`g'
     Prompt for a URL in the minibuffer and make emacs-w3m display the
     corresponding page (independently of the position of the point)
     in an emacs-w3m buffer.  This binding will be familiar to you if
     you already use Gnus or Mew (`w3m-goto-url').

`G'
     Prompt for a URL in the minibuffer, and display it in a new
     session.  This function works just like `g'(M-x w3m-goto-url),
     except that it opens a new session.  When you use emacs-w3m on
     Emacs 21, 22 or XEmacs, opening a new session means displaying
     the page in a new tab.  For more information about tabs, please
     refer to *Note Using Tabs:: (`w3m-goto-url-new-session').

`c'
     Display the URL of the page being displayed in the echo area and
     put it in the `kill-ring' (`w3m-print-current-url').

`u'
     Display the target URL of the link under point in the echo area
     and put it in the `kill-ring' (`w3m-print-this-url').

If the page you're reading is today's news or someone's diary, it may
have been updated since you loaded it.  You can refresh the page using
the following command.  (This command can also be useful to force a
full redisplay of the page if it looks broken.)

`R'
     Reload the page (`w3m-reload-this-page').

Moving from place to place in a page
------------------------------------

Being able to use familiar Emacs movement bindings while browsing a
web page probably fascinates you already.  Believe it or not, there is
more!  Since we value your time, we have added keys to move the point,
scroll the page or find links in a very fast way.  When you master
them, you will understand how handy they are.

The keys are assigned so that scroll commands can be called using
shorter keystrokes than standard Emacs key bindings.  And since places
where you can input text are pretty specific in web pages (*Note
Submitting Forms::), most keys have special meanings and aren't
assigned to `self-insert-command' anymore.

`SPC'
     Scroll downwards.  You may be used to this binding if you use the
     `more' or `less' commands, or Emacs's `view-mode'
     (`w3m-scroll-up-or-next-url').

`DEL'
     Scroll upwards.  You may be used to this binding if you use the
     `less' command or Emacs's `view-mode'
     (`w3m-scroll-down-or-previous-url').

`>'
     Scroll to the left.  The scroll step is given by the
     `w3m-horizontal-scroll-columns' variable, default 10
     (`w3m-scroll-left').

`<'
     Scroll to the right.  The scroll step is given by the
     `w3m-horizontal-scroll-columns' variable, default 10
     (`w3m-scroll-right').

`.'
     Shift to the left (a fine level horizontal scrolling).  The shift
     step is given by the `w3m-horizontal-shift-columns' variable,
     default 2 (`w3m-shift-left').

`,'
     Shift to the right (a fine level horizontal scrolling).  The
     shift step is given by the `w3m-horizontal-shift-columns'
     variable, default 2 (`w3m-shift-right').

`M-l'
     Scroll horizontally so that the current position is centered
     (`w3m-horizontal-recenter').

The `w3m-mode' major mode defines commands to move to various kinds of
things; namely links, forms, and images (whether they are displayed or
not).

Let's consider this simple example: suppose we want to search for a
word on the widely-known Google search engine.  Step one: open
`http://www.google.com' in emacs-w3m.  Step two: once the page is
loaded, hit `]'.  Tadaa!  The point has moved to the first form input
in the page, you can now hit `RET' to enter something in it, and then
`C-c C-c' to submit.  Without this command, you would have had to move
into the page using `C-n', `C-f' and so forth, it would have been a
real pain.

TAB
     Move the point to the next link (an "anchor" in emacs-w3m lingo).
     More strictly speaking, move the point forwards to the nearest
     anchor.

`M-TAB'
`S-TAB'
     Move the point to the previous anchor.  More strictly speaking,
     move the point backwards to the nearest anchor
     (`w3m-previous-anchor').

`]'
     Move the point to the next form.  More strictly speaking, move
     the point forwards to the nearest form (`w3m-next-form').

`['
     Move the point to the previous form.  More strictly speaking,
     move the point backwards to the nearest form
     (`w3m-previous-form').

`}'
     Move the point to the next image.  More strictly speaking, move
     the point forwards to the nearest image (`w3m-next-image').

`{'
     Move the point to the previous image.  More strictly speaking,
     move the point backwards to the nearest image
     (`w3m-previous-image').

Moving from page to page
------------------------

This section explains how to move from page to page, but not by
following links or inputing URLs (these ways of moving are explained in
*Note Launching and Jumping::).

This includes commands to move backwards and forwards in history (the
familiar "Back" and "Forward" from other browsers), and the obligatory
Go to the home page" feature.  You will probably understand this
better after reading the *Note Tracing History:: section.

`B'
     Move back one page in history (`w3m-view-previous-page').  With a
     numeric argument ARG, move back ARG pages.  This is the preferred
     way to go back in time.

`N'
     Move forward one page in history (`w3m-view-next-page').  Of
     course, this will work only if you've used `B' to move back in
     history.  If called with a numeric argument ARG, move forward ARG
     pages.  This command actually allows you to go back to the
     future!

`H'
     Move to the home page (`w3m-gohome').  You can specify the URL of
     the home page by customizing the `w3m-home-page' variable
     ("about:" by default).

These commands are exclusive features of emacs-w3m, we were able to
obtain patents on them, so you won't find them anywhere else.  That's
why you must learn to use them today!  (Just kidding.)

`^'
     Attempt to move to the parent directory of the page currently
     displayed.  For instance, it will attempt to move to
     http://foo/" when "http://foo/bar/" is displayed.  This function
     has been implemented because of the following observation: users
     of web browsers often have to move up one level of directories
     because the information they're looking for isn't displayed on
     the current page (either because it has been deleted, or because
     a search engine took them to the wrong page).

     When you use another web browser, you usually need to remove the
     last component from the URL by using the DEL key, etc. several
     times manually.  In emacs-w3m, this operation can be performed in
     only one keystroke, by typing `^'!

SPC
     When the current point is located at the end of the buffer and
     you cannot scroll down further, hit the SPC key to go on to the
     next page" (`w3m-scroll-up-or-next-url').  Here, "next page"
     means the page referred to in the special "next" header of the
     current page (read on).  This feature has nothing to do with the
     history.

     You probably noticed that some websites split their contents over
     several small pages, partly because it's not comfortable for
     users to wait for huge contents to transfer in one go.  For
     example, search results of search engines often appear like that.
     On such sites, users often need to follow links manually from one
     page to the next in order the access all the information.

     Hopefully emacs-w3m attempts to enable you to browse a series of
     contents over pages as if you were viewing them as a single page,
     by combining two operations: explicitly following links and
     scrolling.

     That's how it works: these kinds of websites often have fields
     such as "next", "prev" or "previous" in the headers of their web
     pages.  These fields contain information about links between
     divided pages.  Emacs-w3m uses these fields to know what to
     follow.

     Let's take an example with Google again to explain how the two
     operations (following links and scrolling) are combined.  Open
     `http://www.google.com' and search for a word.  If you search for
     a very common word (e.g. "hamburger"), you will get tons of
     search results.  Google returns the first page of search results,
     after having sorted them using its own algorithm and divided them
     into several pages.  Use SPC to scroll through this first page.
     Keep scrolling until you see the end of the web page in the
     window.  Here, a surprise is waiting for you.  If you use a web
     browser other than emacs-w3m and want to see the rest of the
     search results, you would have to click on any of the numbers
     listed under

          Gooooooogle


          1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8...


     to follow the link.  But with emacs-w3m, you can follow the link
     by just typing SPC, just as if you were scrolling!


DEL
     When the point is located at the beginning of the buffer and you
     cannot scroll upward, hit the DEL to go to the "previous" page
     (`w3m-scroll-down-or-previous-url').  Here, the "previous" page
     means the page which is assigned to the "prev" or "previous"
     fields in the header of the current page.  This function has
     nothing to do with the history, and works like
     SPC(w3m-scroll-up-or-next-url).

Surfing using the mouse
-----------------------

The emacs-w3m developers went to some trouble to ensure that normal
people who aren't Emacs otaku can also use emacs-w3m.  You can perform
most web browsing operations using only the mouse except for entering
text, e.g. URL, forms, etc.  Note that sometimes you might still need
to use modifier keys since the emacs-w3m developers are all Emacs
otaku...

Use `mouse-2' to "follow links" (the first basic of web browsing).
Under Emacs 22.1 and newer, you can also follow links using
`mouse-1', depending of the value of
`mouse-1-click-follows-link'.

`mouse-2'
     Follow the link under the mouse pointer
     (`w3m-mouse-view-this-url').

`S-mouse-2'
     Follow the link under the mouse pointer in a new session
     (`w3m-mouse-view-this-url-new-session').

Scrollbar, menubar and toolbar are helpful in emacs-w3m when you use a
mouse (your Emacs must support them, and you must have enabled them).
You can scroll an emacs-w3m window using the scrollbar.  You can
invoke many emacs-w3m commands described in this manual from the "W3M"
menu which appears in the leftmost menubar next to the "File" menu.
Note: it's not necessary to use the menubar for most emacs-w3m
commands, you can use the toolbar icons instead.

To switch between buffers in an emacs-w3m window using "Tabs" (*Note
Using Tabs::), click on the topmost line in an emacs-w3m window
directory using `mouse-2' or choose one from the "TAB" menu which
appears next to the "W3M" menu.

Return to an Ordinary Life
--------------------------

Think back.  You probably didn't start Emacs to browse the web, but
to, say, replace some editor's built-in interpreter with scheme, write
Info documentation or put into print your opinion on software
patents...  who knows?  While you were using Emacs, you ran into the
need to browse the web for your work.  But you happened to be able to
see the web page without leaving Emacs at all.  Wow.

Now the time has come to return to work.  Keep it up or the world
won't change!  Type `q' if you think you might need to browse the web
again.  Type `Q' if you don't have any intention to go back to
emacs-w3m for a while.

`q'
     Close an emacs-w3m window and select the other buffer
     (`w3m-close-window').

`Q'
     Save the "arrived URLs" list to disk (*Note Tracing History::),
     save cookies (*Note Cookie Variables::) and really quit emacs-w3m
     (`w3m-quit').



File: emacs-w3m.info, Node: Inline Images, Next: Tracing History, Prev: Browsing Web Pages, Up: Basic Usage

Toggle displaying inline images
===============================

If the Emacs version you're using is capable of displaying images in
buffers, then emacs-w3m can display them in web pages, just like
graphical" browsers like Mozilla do.  You should make sure your Emacs
is correctly setup for images before trying to use any of the
following commands (*Note Required Emacs Version::).

To toggle displaying of images in the current buffer, use `T'.  It
makes emacs-w3m fetch the images from the server, then display them in
the buffer, at the position they would have in a "graphical" browser.
If you hit the key again, images will disappear from the buffer.

By default, emacs-w3m won't display images, but you can change its
behavior and choose to always display images, for this you need to
customize the `w3m-default-display-inline-images' variable and change
its value from `nil' to `t'.  *Note Customizable Variables::.

Emacs-w3m also comes with nifty features that let you zoom an image in
or out, save it to a file, or view it in a external viewer.  See also
*Note Moving in a page:: for instructions on how to move from image to
image in an emacs-w3m buffer.

`T'
     Toggle displaying of inline images in this buffer and buffers
     created from this buffer, later on (`w3m-toggle-inline-images').

`I'
     View the image under point in an external viewer
     (`w3m-view-image').

`M-i'
     Save the image under point to an external file.  The default name
     will be the original name of the image, so most of the time `M-i
     RET' will save the image with the right name (`w3m-save-image').

`M-['
     Zoom out the image under point (`w3m-zoom-out-image').

`M-]'
     Zoom in the image under point (`w3m-zoom-in-image').



File: emacs-w3m.info, Node: Tracing History, Next: Managing Bookmarks, Prev: Inline Images, Up: Basic Usage

Going back through time and space
=================================

Emacs-w3m has several ways to present you with a list of all the pages
you visited before.  The first way is simply called the "emacs-w3m
history", it is a list of the pages you visited in this session,
presented hierarchically, that is: when you follow a link, the page
you're leaving becomes the "parent" of the page you're going to.  It
is a very nice to keep track of the pages you visited, and remember
from where you came if the history gets too long.

Here is an example of this feature in action, after a short visit to
the GNU Project's homepage:

     GNU's Not Unix! - the GNU Project and the Free Software Foundation (FSF)
       Philosophy of the GNU Project - Free Software Foundation (FSF)

          Order from the Free Software Foundation (FSF)

         EFF: Homepage

(In fact, this example is slightly edited to fit in 72 columns; the
URLs won't be cut in the actual emacs-w3m buffer.)

You can get this kind of history using the `s' key in any emacs-w3m
buffer.

Please note that this history is buffer-local, i.e. specific to an
emacs-w3m buffer.  But emacs-w3m has a unique feature: when you visit
a new page, the history is copied over to the new buffer, so that you
can still access the pages you visited so far.  This is different from
the way Mozilla and others work; in these browsers the history always
starts from scratch in new buffers.

Emacs-w3m can do more than just record which pages you visited, it can
also save specific locations in those pages, in case you want to go
back to the exact same place in the page.  Press `C-c C-@', and the
location of the cursor will be stored in history.  In order to go back
to that particular location within the page, press `C-c C-v' in the
emacs-w3m buffer visiting the page.

`s'
     Display the list of visited URLs in this session.

`C-c C-@'
     Record the position of the cursor in the page in history.

`C-c C-v'
     Move to the position which has been marked with `C-c C-@'
     (`w3m-history-store-position') in the currently displayed page.

The other way to have information about past pages is the "arrived
URLs" list: it is a list of the last 500 URLs you have visited in
emacs-w3m.  The list is ordered by date, the most recent coming first,
and for each page the time of visit is displayed.  Here's an example

You can get this history by passing a prefix argument to the previous
command, i.e. using `C-u s'.  The number of URLs showed in this page
is customizable, see the `w3m-keep-arrived-urls' variable.  It cannot
exceed 500 by default.  *Note Customizable Variables::.

Of course, in all cases all the lines showed in the examples are
links, you can go to any of the pages you visited previously just like
if you were visiting a regular page, by following the link.

`s'
`C-u s'
     Display the list of URLs visited in this session.  If called with
     a prefix argument, show the list of arrived URLs instead
     (`w3m-history').

Also see the *Note Moving over pages:: section, it explains how to
move in the history with simple keybindings, i.e. the "Back" and
Next" features.



File: emacs-w3m.info, Node: Managing Bookmarks, Next: Using Tabs, Prev: Tracing History, Up: Basic Usage

That's a favorite with me!
==========================

Like all modern browsers, emacs-w3m has advanced features related to
bookmarks: it lets you classify them in categories, edit them and of
course, browse them easily.

* Menu:

* Adding Bookmarks::            Adding a URL to your favorites
* Consulting Bookmarks::        Browse your bookmarks
* Editing Bookmarks::           How to change your bookmarks



File: emacs-w3m.info, Node: Adding Bookmarks, Next: Consulting Bookmarks, Prev: Managing Bookmarks, Up: Managing Bookmarks

Adding a URL to your favorites
------------------------------

There are several ways to add a URL to your bookmarks.  The first one
is to use the `a' key (or call the `w3m-bookmark-add-current-url'
command) to add the page you're currently browsing: it will prompt you
for a section to where the bookmark should go (completion is available
with the TAB key) and will let you edit the title of the bookmark (the
default being the title of the current page).  Complete these two
steps, validating each with `RET', and you will see the message
Added" in the minibuffer, which means (surprise!) that the page has
been added to your bookmarks.

Another way to add a bookmark is to use the `M-a' key (or call the
`w3m-bookmark-add-this-url' command): it adds the URL under point
(that means, the URL you would be taken to if you followed the link)
to the bookmarks.  As before, you will have to input the section for
this bookmark and its title, the default being this time the name of
the link itself.

The third and final way to do this is to use `C-u a', this time you
will be prompted for the URL to add, its section, and the title to use
for it in the bookmarks.

`a'
     Add the current page to the bookmarks, or if called with a prefix

Browse your bookmarks
---------------------

The easiest way to see the bookmarks is to use the `v' key in an
emacs-w3m buffer; another possibility is to go to the special URL
`about://bookmark/'.  You will see your bookmarks, organized by
section, each line being one bookmark.  You can browse them exactly
like you would browse any other page.

On the bookmarks page a w3m minor mode is activated, the bookmark
mode.  It adds key bindings to edit the bookmarks.  *Note Editing
Bookmarks::.

`v'
     Visit the bookmarks page (`w3m-bookmark-view').



File: emacs-w3m.info, Node: Editing Bookmarks, Prev: Consulting Bookmarks, Up: Managing Bookmarks

How to change your bookmarks
----------------------------

The bookmark minor mode (*Note Consulting Bookmarks::) offers several
key bindings related to bookmark edition, most noticeably `C-k' to
kill (i.e. delete) a bookmark, and `E' to edit the bookmark file.

Bookmarks are kept in an HTML file, so you can edit the file by hand,
but be very careful: if you erase the comments emacs-w3m needs to
recognize section names, things can break easily.  If you know the
basics of HTML, the file should otherwise be quite self-explanatory.

`C-k'
     Kill the bookmark under point (`w3m-bookmark-kill-entry').

`E'
     Visit the bookmarks file (`w3m-bookmark-edit').

`C-_'
     Undo the last changes (`w3m-bookmark-undo').

Everybody likes tabs
====================

Unlike most other text-based browsers, emacs-w3m has support for
tabbed browsing (1) (*Note Using Tabs-Footnotes::).  What is tabbed
browsing, you might ask?  It's very simple: it is a way to represent
all active emacs-w3m buffers in a single window, by showing a line at
the top which shows all the buffers in a simple and self-explaining
way, each buffer being shown as a "tab".  This line stays visible all
the time and does not scroll with the rest of the buffer, so that you
can switch to another buffer, or use the feedback it provides at any
moment.

The easiest way to get the feeling of it is to just try, so go on and
open an emacs-w3m session.  If you didn't change anything to the
configuration, the tabs line is active by default, it is this bright
line at the top with a smaller rectangle that shows the title of the
current page.  Now create another w3m buffer (with `G', for example):
now you have two of these rectangles.  These are tabs.

The most obvious use of tabs is switching: by clicking with the
`mouse-1' button on a tab, you make the buffer it represents active.
It also works with the `mouse-2' button.  It's a very quick and easy
way to work with several emacs-w3m buffers, you just have to point and
click.  (Yeah yeah, I hear you.  You want to switch using the
keyboard.  Don't worry, it's also possible.  It's explained in the
next section.  Now keep quiet and read on!)

Another nifty feature is the feedback it provides.  If you are on a
color terminal or window system, emacs-w3m shows the text in the tab
in different colors to show the status of the page (2) (*Note Using
Tabs-Footnotes::).  For example, when the page is being loaded, the
text is in red, and goes back to its default color (usually black)
when the loading is complete.  This way you can tell with a single
glance at the tabs line if the page you're waiting for has arrived or
not.

Finally, if the web page provides a favicon, it will be shown in the
tab as well (3) (*Note Using Tabs-Footnotes::).  More eye-candy for
the emacs-w3m user!

User options:

`w3m-use-tab'
     Whether to activate tabbed browsing or not.


File: emacs-w3m.info  Node: Using Tabs-Footnotes, Up: Using Tabs

(1) It's nobody's fault but Emacs 19 or 20 users cannot use tabs.

(2) Although XEmacs shows all tabs in the same colors at every moment,
you can easily distinguish the selected tab and others and see the
status of the current page in the modeline.

(3) Under XEmacs, favicons will currently not be shown in the tabs
line.

Creating, killing and moving across buffers
===========================================

Sooner or later, you will be addicted to emacs-w3m, and you'll have to
manage all your browsing needs with it.  To help you with this
daunting task, we have imagined many different ways to work with
emacs-w3m buffers.

* Menu:

* Creating and killing buffers:: Creating and killing buffers
* Moving across buffers::        Moving across buffers
* Selecting buffers::            Selecting buffers from a list



File: emacs-w3m.info, Node: Creating and killing buffers, Next: Moving across buffers, Prev: Working with buffers, Up: Working with buffers

Creating and killing buffers
----------------------------

It is sometimes useful to just create a new buffer without opening a
web page in it.  This operation is called "creating a twin copy" of a
buffer, in emacs-w3m lingo.  It will simply create a new buffer whose
contents are identical to the currently active buffer.

The opposite of this is closing buffers: you can just close one buffer
(because you're not interested in its contents anymore) or you can
decide to close all buffers but the current one.  Emacs-w3m lets you
do this with the following commands:

`C-c C-t'
     Create an identical copy of the currently active buffer, under a
     new name.  This is used to start a new session without loading a
     web page in the new buffer (`w3m-copy-buffer').

`C-c C-w'
     Close the current emacs-w3m buffer (`w3m-delete-buffer').

`C-c M-w'
     Close all emacs-w3m buffers, but the active one
     (`w3m-delete-other-buffers').



File: emacs-w3m.info, Node: Moving across buffers, Next: Selecting buffers, Prev: Creating and killing buffers, Up: Working with buffers

Moving across buffers
---------------------

The commands you will probably use most often are those who allow you
to go to an adjacent buffer; that is a buffer just "after" or "before"
the current one.  The meaning of this will be obvious if you use tabs:
the next buffer is the one just after the active one, on the right,
and the previous buffer is the one on the left.  However, XEmacs
displays tabs in random order unfortunately, so you need to pay
attention to the number which is displayed in each tab in order to
know what is the adjacent buffer if you are using XEmacs.  The key
bindings for these commands are `C-c C-p' and `C-c C-n'.

These commands understand the numeric argument convention, i.e. if you
call them with a number N as argument, you will be taken N buffers
away from the current one.  For example, to go two buffers on the
right from the current position, use `2 C-c C-n' (1) (*Note Moving
across buffers-Footnotes::).

`C-c C-p'
     Move to the previous emacs-w3m buffer.  This is usually the next
     buffer to the left in the tabs line under Emacs 21 and later.  If
     called with a numeric argument N, move N buffers to the previous
     (`w3m-previous-buffer').

`C-c C-n'
     Move to the next emacs-w3m buffer.  This is usually the next
     buffer to the right in the tabs line under Emacs 21 and later.
     If called with a numeric argument N, move N buffers to the next
     (`w3m-next-buffer').

Also note that if these commands don't fit you well despite our
efforts, you might find what you need in "generalist" buffer
management packages such as ibuffer or iswitchb--since emacs-w3m
buffers are regular Emacs buffers, they will work fine too.


File: emacs-w3m.info  Node: Moving across buffers-Footnotes, Up: Moving across buffers

(1) You can use `C-u 2 C-c C-n' instead of `2 C-c C-n' as
usual.  But keep in mind all numeric keys and minus-sign are assigned
to the numeric prefix arguments in emacs-w3m buffers.



File: emacs-w3m.info, Node: Selecting buffers, Prev: Moving across buffers, Up: Working with buffers

Selecting buffers from a list
-----------------------------

There are two ways to select emacs-w3m buffers from a list.  The first
one is a minibuffer-based interface, called with `C-c C-a'.  You can
choose the buffer you want to display using the `M-p' and `M-n' keys
(or the "up" and "down" arrow keys), they will make you cycle through
the list.  You can also edit the prompt and type the title of an
existing web page, using `TAB' for completion.  For example, if you
have a "Google Search" page opened, you can type "Goo" then hit `TAB'
and the page title will be completed.  After the page name, the buffer
name is given (between brackets).  Then use `RET' to switch to the
buffer you have chosen.

The second and more sophisticated interface is called the emacs-w3m
buffer list, it is invoked with `C-c C-s'.  It shows you the list of
all opened buffers in a separate window (either a vertical or a
horizontal window---`C-c C-s' toggles between the two modes) and
allows you to view the buffers in real-time: when you move the point
in the buffer list, the buffer under point is displayed in the main
window, which allows you to have direct visual feedback of the buffer
you're switching to.

To move in the buffer list, you can use the `p' and `n' keys (or the
arrow keys).  In the buffer list, `DEL' and `SPC' allow you to scroll
the buffer displayed in the main window, which is handy if you want to
check that you're seeing the right buffer.  To select the buffer under
point, you can use the `RET' key, in which case the buffer list will
be buried, or the `w' key, in which case the buffer list will remain
visible and the focus given to the main window.

You can also close and create buffers from this menu, using the same
bindings as the one used in regular buffers (*Note Creating and
killing buffers::).

Finally, the `?' key shows a short help, `g' refreshes the list and
the `q' key exits the buffer list, not changing the active buffer.

`C-c C-a'
     Prompt for a buffer name in the minibuffer.  `M-p' and `M-n'
     cycle through the list of existing buffers and `TAB' completes
     (`w3m-switch-buffer').

`C-c C-s'
     Show the buffer list in a separate window (`w3m-select-buffer').
     In this window, `C-c C-s' toggles between horizontal and vertical
     modes, `RET' selects the buffer under point and buries the buffer
     list, `w' selects the buffer under point and gives it the focus,
     `n', `p' and the arrow keys can be used to move down or up.



File: emacs-w3m.info, Node: Downloading, Next: Submitting Forms, Prev: Working with buffers, Up: Basic Usage

Downloading a file
==================

It is possible to download (i.e. fetch, but not display) any web page
or file with emacs-w3m: just put the point on the link you want to
download and hit `d'.  You will be prompted for a filename under which
to save the file locally, by default it will be the name of the file
on the remote server.  Confirm with `RET'.  The download will be
asynchronous and not block your Emacs session, you can continue your
emacs-w3m browsing in another buffer if you want.

Please note that this download mechanism uses w3m to download things,
you might want to use the more powerful wget downloader instead.  Have a
look at our friend project "emacs-wget", its homepage is at
`http://pop-club.hp.infoseek.co.jp/emacs/emacs-wget/'.

`d'
     Download the file or page pointed by the link under point
     (`w3m-download-this-url').



File: emacs-w3m.info, Node: Submitting Forms, Next: HTML File Information, Prev: Downloading, Up: Basic Usage

Filling in HTML forms
=====================

These emacs-w3m commands let you move between forms and fill in
fields, using simple key bindings and optionally prompting you for
values in Emacs windows or in the minibuffer.

The main key binding to remember is `RET'.  It has different meanings,
depending on the thing under point: for textareas, you will be
prompted for a value in the minibuffer.  For select tags, you will be
given a list of choices in an electric Emacs window (you can move
using the arrow keys, and pick one with the `RET' key).  For radio and
checkbox buttons, the `RET' key selects one of the elements.

When in the minibuffer or in the electric window, you can cancel with
the `C-c C-q' sequence.  To submit the form, use `C-c C-c'.

`]'
     Jump to the next form (`w3m-next-form').

`['
     Jump to the previous form (`w3m-previous-form').

`C-c C-c'
     Submit form at point (`w3m-submit-form').

`RET'
     Edit the value of the form item under point.

`RET (w3m-form-*-keymap)'
     Accept the value.

`C-c C-q (w3m-form-*-keymap)'
     Quit editing the form item, leaving changes.

Unless `w3m-form-use-textarea-backup' is set to `nil',
emacs-w3m stores the text you input in textareas in backup files for
later reuse.  When you start editing a form and there is backup text
available, you will be asked whether you want to use it or not.  Files
to save text are stored in the directory specified by the
`w3m-form-textarea-directory' variable.



File: emacs-w3m.info, Node: HTML File Information, Prev: Submitting Forms, Up: Basic Usage

Support for web page editing and hacking
========================================

For those who usually use Emacs to write documentation or programs,
it's very convenient to be able to browse the web in the same Emacs
session.  For example, if you are editing a HTML file in Emacs, you
can preview it without launching an external browser.  You can also
quickly copy sample code from technical documentation during a
programming marathon...

How about the opposite?  (That is, being able to edit the source of a
web page in a web browser.)  Wouldn't that be cool?  Imagine you found
an error in your document after previewing it in emacs-w3m; you
probably want to fix it right away.  Or if you are a programmer
specialized in web technology, sometimes you might want to see the raw
HTML file for the current web page... especially if you are the author
of a Shimbun module (*Note Shimbun Basics::).

It is usually possible to switch to an Emacs buffer visiting an HTML
file by using the buffer name, but emacs-w3m adds a specific
keybinding for this.  Emacs-w3m knows the URL of the web page it is
visiting, so why not take advantage of this?

`\'
     Display the current web page in the raw HTML
     format(`w3m-view-source').

`='
     Show the information about currently displayed web page. It
     includes title, URL, document type, last modified
     date(`w3m-view-header').

`E'
     Edit the local file pointed by URL of current
     page(`w3m-edit-current-url').

`e'
     Edit the local file pointed by URL under
     point(`w3m-edit-this-url').

`M'
     Launch an external browser (other than emacs-w3m) and display the same
     web page as currently displayed in
     emacs-w3m(`w3m-view-url-with-external-browser').  The external
     browser to be used is defined by the variable
     `w3m-content-type-alist', depending on the kind of URL.


The (*Note Tips::) section gives more examples on how to integrate
emacs-w3m with other commands and Emacs subsystems.

Convenient ways to search the web
=================================

Emacs-w3m comes with advanced features related to search engines, they
are accessible through two interfaces:

   * The regular interface, invoked by the `S' key in any emacs-w3m
     buffer.  It is a simple interactive way to choose which search
     engine to use and input a search term; see *Note The Search
     Interface::.

   * The Quicksearch interface: it is a faster (yet more complicated)
     way to use search engines, by going to specially crafted URLs.
     For more information about this feature, see *Note Quick
     Searching::.

* Menu:

* The Search Interface::        How to search with emacs-w3m
* Quick Searching::             An alternative (and fast) way to search the web
* Adding New Search Engines::   Using your favorite engines



File: emacs-w3m.info, Node: The Search Interface, Next: Quick Searching, Prev: Using Search Engines, Up: Using Search Engines

How to search with emacs-w3m
----------------------------

You can fire up the regular search interface by using the `S' key in
an emacs-w3m buffer (provided you use the default keymap).  You will
see a prompt in the minibuffer, asking for a search term.  Type one or
several words at the prompt, then hit `RET'.  The result page of your
search in the engine appears, you can then browse the results, just as
if you had used the normal web based entry point to the engine.

You probably noticed that you have not been given a chance to choose
which engine you want to search with.  By default, emacs-w3m will use
the Google search engine, you can change this behavior by customizing
the `w3m-search-default-engine' variable (see *Note Customizable
Variables::), or you can specify the search engine each time you use
the command.

To specify which engine to use, you have to give the command a prefix
argument (usually, this means hitting `C-u' before the command,
e.g. `C-u S').  Emacs-w3m will prompt you for an engine, you can
choose one by typing its name (completion is also available with the
TAB key).  Once you have made your choice, hit the `RET' key.  You can
then type your search term, hit `RET', and you will see the search
results.

`S'
     Begin a new search.  If called with a prefix argument, prompt for
     the engine to use (`w3m-search').



File: emacs-w3m.info, Node: Quick Searching, Next: Adding New Search Engines, Prev: The Search Interface, Up: Using Search Engines

An alternative (and fast) way to search the web
-----------------------------------------------

If you're a "Web Power User" (and since you're reading this, you
probably are), you need a quick and efficient way to perform searches.
The Quick Searching feature is one.

What does it do?  It lets you launch web searches by simply going to a
special URL such as `gg:emacs'.  The advantages of this mode of
operation are:

   * It's fast.  You just have to type a URL to choose the engine and
     the search word(s), in one go.

   * It's convenient.  With this feature, you can easily open a new
     emacs-w3m tab or window, and launch a search in it, using for
     example, the `G' key to open a URL in a new window, and going to
     a Quicksearch URL.  You can also bookmark searches just by
     bookmarking the special Quicksearch URL.

   * It works with the grouping feature.  You can launch two searches
     at the same time, with a URL like `group:gg:emacs&ya:w3m'.  This
     would for instance launch a search for "emacs" on Google and for
     w3m" on Yahoo!.  *Note Grouping URLs::.

Using it is very simple: suppose you want to search for the word "gnu"
on Google.  Hit `g' to go to a new URL, and type "gg:gnu".  The
first part of this expression, "gg" indicates that we want to use the
Google search engine.  The second term is the word we will be searching
for.  The prefix and the search term must be separated by a colon.  Hit
`RET', and you will see the results of your search.  Please note
that you can input several words by separating them with spaces (to
type a space in the minibuffer, hit `C-q' first, e.g. `C-q
SPC').

The default configuration of emacs-w3m includes several prefixes you
can use, they are defined in the `w3m-uri-replace-alist' variable.
There's for example "gg" for Google, "ggg" for Google Groups, "ya" for
Yahoo!, "al" for Altavista, to name a few.  You can also add prefixes
for the search engines you define, *Note Adding New Search Engines::.

Instead of prefixes, you can also use full engine names in Quicksearch
URLs, such as "google" or "yahoo".  These names are defined in the
`w3m-search-engine-alist' variable.



File: emacs-w3m.info, Node: Adding New Search Engines, Prev: Quick Searching, Up: Using Search Engines

Using your favorite engines
---------------------------

Emacs-w3m has a number of built-in search engines you can use.  What
if you want to use your favorite search engine and it's not listed in
the known search engines?  You have to add it to the list of search
engines, and it's quite easy:

  1. First, you have to find what's the entry point of the search
     engine you want to add, for example:

     `http://my.searchengine.com/?query=foobar'

     where foobar is the term you want to search for.

  2. Once you have this information, add this to your `~/.emacs-w3m'
     file:

          (eval-after-load "w3m-search"
            '(add-to-list 'w3m-search-engine-alist
                          '("My engine"
                            "http://my.searchengine.com/?query=%s"
                            nil)))

     Replace the first field "My engine" with the description of your
     engine, the second field with the entry point (the `%s' is
     important, it will be replaced by the search term when you issue the
     search), and the third field is the encoding to use, `nil' or
     omitting this field means to use the value of
     `w3m-default-coding-system' as a regular encoding.

     For English search engines, you rarely have to worry about this.
     However, for some Japanese search engines, you may need to
     specify something (e.g. `euc-japan') there.

  3. You can now use this engine to search, using the normal `S' key
     in emacs-w3m.  If you use this engine often, you can also add it
     to the Quicksearch (see *Note Quick Searching::) engines and give
     it a small prefix, by adding this to your `~/.emacs-w3m' file
     instead:

          (eval-after-load "w3m-search"
            '(progn
               (add-to-list 'w3m-search-engine-alist
                            '("My engine"
                              "http://my.searchengine.com/?query=%s"
                              nil))
               (add-to-list 'w3m-uri-replace-alist
                            '("\\`my:" w3m-search-uri-replace "My engine"))))

     This way you can also use a URL like `my:foobar' to search for
     the term "foobar" with your engine.



File: emacs-w3m.info, Node: Grouping URLs, Next: Weather Information, Prev: Using Search Engines, Up: Pretty Good Features

Visiting several web pages in one URL
=====================================

Emacs-w3m can manipulate "group URLs": special URLs that contain
several real URLs.  When you open these group URLs, emacs-w3m will
open one buffer for each URL in the group, allowing you to open
several pages in one go.

To build group URLs, you just have to put together (i.e. concatenate)
all the addresses you want to open, separating them with the ampersand
symbol (that's "&"), and prefixing the grouped URLs with "group:".
For example, suppose you want to visit the GNU Project's homepage,
`http://www.gnu.org/', and the Savannah homepage,
`http://savannah.nongnu.org/': the group URL would be

`group:http://www.gnu.org/&http://savannah.nongnu.org/'

Since this syntax can be quite hard to use on a daily basis, this
feature will be most useful when used with very short URLs
(Quicksearch URLs for example, see *Note Quick Searching::); or in
non-interactive contexts.

line stands for one website of the Antenna database, and has the
following structure:

`  * 2002/12/15 16:43  (T)  My website'

The first part is the last time the website was updated, or if this
information is not available, the last time Antenna noticed a change
in this page.

The `(T)' stands for "Time", it means that the change was detected
because the last modification time of that page has changed since the
last Antenna update.  Another possible value here is `S' (for "Size"),
which means that the change has been detected because the size of the
page has changed.

The last part of this line is the title you gave to this website when
you added it to the database.

Please note that the Antenna database doesn't get automatically
updated, you have to update it each time you want to check if the
sites have changed, either by hitting `R' in the Antenna page, or by
passing a prefix argument to the command (start Antenna with `C-u A',
for example).

`A'
     Visit the Antenna page.  If called with a prefix argument, update
     the Antenna database before displaying it (`w3m-antenna').

Showing the tree structure of local directories
===============================================

Using the `w3m-dtree' command, you can display a tree of all
subdirectories of a local directory, and browse it like a regular web
page.  The emacs-w3m buffer you get when you use this feature is very
similar to the output of the external "tree" utility, hence the name.
Emacs-w3m adds a bonus: if you call the command with a prefix
argument, it will display files as well, turning emacs-w3m into a
full-featured file browser.

Here is an example of what an emacs-w3m dtree run looks like:

     /home/romain/.elisp/emacs-w3m/
      |-CVS/
      |-attic/
      |  +-CVS/
      |-autom4te.cache/
      |-doc/
      |  |-CVS/
      |  +-emacs-w3m/
      |-icons/
      |  +-CVS/
      |-patches/
      |  +-CVS/
      +-shimbun/
         +-CVS/

And with a prefix argument, you get something like this instead:

     /home/romain/.elisp/emacs-w3m/ (allfiles)
      |-(f).cvsignore
      |-(f)BUGS.ja
      |-(f)COPYING
      |-[d]CVS/
      |  |-(f)Entries
      |  |-(f)Repository
      |  +-(f)Root
      |-(f)ChangeLog
      |-(f)ChangeLog.1
      |-(f)Makefile
      |-(f)Makefile.in
      |-(f)README
      |-(f)README.ja

`D'
     Prompt for a local directory in the minibuffer, then display its
     tree structure.  If called with a prefix argument (e.g. `C-u D'),
     show files in the directories as well (`w3m-dtree').

Customizable variables
**********************

A lot of emacs-w3m variables are customizable via the Custom
mechanism, a graphical Emacs interface to define user options.  Custom
offers several methods to define your customizations, you can use for
example `M-x customize-option' for a single option (i.e. an Emacs Lisp
variable) or `M-x customize-group' to see all available options
(including variables and faces) for a "group" and change them; in
which case the group to use is `w3m'.

Alternatively (if you don't want to use Custom), you can put arbitrary
Emacs Lisp expressions in your emacs-w3m initialization file, which is
`~/.emacs-w3m' by default.  This example:

     (setq w3m-home-page "http://emacs-w3m.namazu.org/")

would set the default homepage to `http://emacs-w3m.namazu.org/'.  The
syntax to use is the same as in your `~/.emacs' file.  *Note Init
File: (emacs)Init File.

Please note that some variables from external modules could be
undefined at the time the `~/.emacs-w3m' file is loaded, thus making
them impossible to modify (of course if you don't care about the
default value, you can override them completely in your
`~/.emacs-w3m') file.  The `w3m-search-engine-alist' variable is a
typical example (*Note Search Variables::).

`w3m-init-file'
     When emacs-w3m starts, it will read the `w3m-init-file' file.  The
     default value is `~/.emacs-w3m'.  You probably don't need to change
     this.  This is a normal Emacs Lisp file and can be used to avoid
     cluttering your `~/.emacs' and `site-init' files with
     emacs-w3m stuff.  Emacs-w3m will also check for files with the same
     names as this, but with `.elc' and `.el' extensions (in other
     words, `~/.emacs-w3m.elc', `~/.emacs-w3m.el' and
     `~/.emacs-w3m', in this order).

General variables
=================

`w3m-accept-languages'
     List of acceptable languages in descending order of priority.
     The default value is set according to the `accept_language' entry
     of the `w3m' configuration file (normally `~/.w3m/config').

`w3m-add-referer'

     Rule of sending referers.  There are five choices as the valid
     values of this option.

       1. `nil': this means that emacs-w3m never send referers.

       2. `t': this means that emacs-w3m always send referers.

       3. `lambda': this means that emacs-w3m send referers only when
          both the current page and the target page are provided by
          the same server.

       4. a cons cell keeping two regular expressions: this means that
          emacs-w3m send referers when the url of the current page
          matches the first regular expression and does not match the
          second regular expression.  `Nil' for the regexp matches any
          url.

       5. a function: emacs-w3m send referers when this function which
          has two arguments, URL and REFERER, returns non-nil.

     If you're nervous about leaking private WEB browsing history
     information, set this option to `nil' or `lambda'.  If your
     computer belongs to a secret network, you may set a pair of
     regular expressions to inhibit sending referers which will
     disclose your private information, as follows:

          (setq w3m-add-referer
                '("\\`http:\"
                  . "\\`http://\\([^./]+\\.\\)*example\\.net/"))

`w3m-add-user-agent'
     Non-`nil' means add the User-Agent field to the request header.
     The value of `w3m-user-agent' is used for the field body.

`w3m-arrived-file'
     Name of the file to keep the arrived URLs database.

`w3m-auto-show'
     Non-`nil' means provide the ability to horizontally scroll the
     window.  Automatic horizontal scrolling happens when the point gets away
     from both ends of the window, but nothing occurs if
     `truncate-lines' is set to `nil'.

     This feature works with specific emacs-w3m code; usual
     `auto-hscroll-mode', `automatic-hscrolling', `auto-show-mode' or
     `hscroll-mode' will all be invalidated in emacs-w3m buffers.

`w3m-charset-coding-system-alist'
     Alist of MIME charsets and coding systems.  Both charsets and
     coding systems must be symbols.

`w3m-coding-system'
     Default coding system used to communicate with the `w3m' command.

`w3m-coding-system-priority-list'
     Coding systems in order of priority used for emacs-w3m sessions.

`w3m-command'
     Name of the executable file of the `w3m' command.  You normally
     don't have to specify the value, since emacs-w3m looks for the
     existing commands `w3m', `w3mmee' and `w3m-m17n' (in this order)
     in the `exec-path' directories in order if it is `nil' in the
     beginning.

     If you want to use the other `w3m' command, specify the value of
     this variable explicitly in the .emacs file or customize the
     value and save it.  In this case, you need to restart Emacs and
     emacs-w3m: there is currently no way to apply the changing of the
     `w3m' command to all the emacs-w3m programs safely after loading
     the `w3m.elc' module.

`w3m-command-arguments'
     List of the default arguments passed to the `w3m' command.  See
     also `w3m-command-arguments-alist'.

`w3m-command-arguments-alist'
     Alist of regexps matching urls and additional arguments passed to
     `w3m'.  A typical usage of this variable is to specify whether to
     use a proxy server for particular hosts.  The first match made
     will be used.  Here is an example of how to set this variable:

          (setq w3m-command-arguments-alist
                '(;; Don't use the proxy server to visit local web pages.
                  ("^http://\\([^/]*\\.\\)*your-company\\.com\\(/\\|$\\)"
                   "-no-proxy")
                  ;; Use the proxy server to visit any foreign urls.
                  (""
                   "-o" "http_proxy=http://proxy.your-company.com:8080/")))

     Here the first element matches any url where the scheme is `http'
     and the hostname is either `your-company.com' or a name ending
     with `.your-company.com'; the proxy server is not used for those
     hosts.  If you are a regexp novice, you can use the
     `w3m-no-proxy-domains' variable instead.

`w3m-command-environment'
     Alist of environment variables for subprocesses to inherit.

`w3m-content-type-alist'
     Alist of file suffixes and content types.

`w3m-correct-charset-alist'
     Alist of MIME charsets; strange ones and standard ones.

`w3m-db-history-display-size'
     Maximum number of arrived URLs which are displayed per page.

`w3m-decoder-alist'
     Alist of encoding types, decoder commands, and arguments.

`w3m-default-coding-system'
     Default coding system used to encode url strings and post-data.

`w3m-default-content-type'
     Default value assumed as the content type of local files.

`w3m-default-save-directory'
     Default directory where downloaded files will be saved to.

`w3m-delete-duplicated-empty-lines'
     Non-`nil' means display two or more continuous empty lines into
     single.

`w3m-dirlist-cgi-program'
     Name of the CGI program to list a local directory.  If it is
     `nil', the dirlist.cgi module of the `w3m' command will be used.

`w3m-edit-function'
     Function used for editing local files.  It is used when the
     `w3m-edit-current-url' command or the `w3m-edit-this-url' command
     is invoked.

`w3m-edit-function-alist'
     Alist of functions used for editing pages.  This option is refered to
     decide which function shouled be used to edit a specified page, when
     either `w3m-edit-current-url' or `w3m-edit-this-url' is
     invoked.  When no suitable function is found from this alist,
     `w3m-edit-function' is used.

`w3m-encoding-type-alist'
     Alist of file suffixes and content encoding types.

`w3m-file-coding-system'
     Coding system used when writing configuration files.  This value
     will be referred to by the `w3m-save-list' function.

`w3m-file-name-coding-system'
     Coding system used to convert pathnames when emacs-w3m accesses
     files.

`w3m-fill-column'
     Integer used as the value for `fill-column' in emacs-w3m buffers.
     If it is positive, pages will be displayed within the columns of
     that number.  If it is zero or negative, the number of columns
     which subtracted that number from the window width is applied to
     the maximum width of pages.  Note that XEmacs does not always
     obey this setting.

`w3m-follow-redirection'
     Maximum number of redirections which emacs-w3m honors and
     follows.  If `nil', redirections are followed by the `w3m'
     command.  Don't set it to `nil' if you allow to use cookies
     (i.e., you have set `w3m-use-cookies' to non-`nil') since cookies
     may be shared among many redirected pages.

`w3m-home-page'
     This variable specifies the url string to open when emacs-w3m
     starts.  Don't say HP, it's the abbreviated name of a certain
     company. ;-)

`w3m-horizontal-scroll-columns'
     Number of steps in columns used when scrolling a window
     horizontally.

`w3m-horizontal-scroll-division'
     Integer used by the program making the point certainly visible.
     The cursor definitely does not go missing even when it has been
     driven out of the window while wandering around anchors and forms
     in an emacs-w3m buffer.

     Suppose that the value of this variable is N.  When the point is
     outside the left of the window, emacs-w3m scrolls the window so
     that the point may be displayed on the position within 1/N of the
     width of the window from the left.  Similarly, when the point is
     outside the right of the window, emacs-w3m scrolls the window so
     that the point may be displayed on the position of 1/N of the
     width of the window from the right.

     This feature doesn't work if `w3m-auto-show' is `nil'.  The value
     must be a larger integer than 1.

`w3m-horizontal-shift-columns'
     Number of steps in columns used when shifting a window
     horizontally.  The term `shifting' means a fine level scrolling.

`w3m-imitate-widget-button'
     If non-`nil', imitate the widget buttons on link (anchor)
     buttons.  It is useful for moving about in a Gnus article buffer
     using `TAB' key.  It can also be any Lisp form that should return
     a boolean value.

`w3m-init-file'
     Your emacs-w3m startup file name.  If a file with the `.el' or
     `.elc' suffixes exists, it will be read instead.

     Note: This file is used as the startup configuration *NOT* for
     the `w3m' command but for emacs-w3m.  In order to modify
     configurations for the `w3m' command, edit the file named
     `~/.w3m/config' normally.

`w3m-input-coding-system'
     Coding system used when writing to `w3m' processes.  It overrides
     `coding-system-for-write' if it is not `binary'.  Otherwise, the
     value of the `w3m-current-coding-system' variable is used
     instead.

`w3m-keep-arrived-urls'
     Maximum number of URLs which the arrived URLs database keeps.

`w3m-keep-cache-size'
     Maximum number of pages to be cached in emacs-w3m.

`w3m-key-binding'
     Type of key binding set used in emacs-w3m sessions.  The valid
     values include `info' which provides Info-like keys, and `nil'
     which provides Lynx-like keys.

`w3m-language'
     Your preferred language used in emacs-w3m sessions.

`w3m-local-directory-view-method'
     Symbol of the method to view a local directory tree.  The valid values
     include `w3m-cgi' using the CGI program specified by the
     `w3m-dirlist-cgi-program' variable (which see), and
     `w3m-dtree' using the w3m-dtree Lisp module.

`w3m-local-find-file-function'
     Function used to open local files.  If a url of the `file:'
     scheme in which you entered agrees with the rule of the
     `w3m-local-find-file-regexps' variable (which see), it is used to
     open the file.

     Function should take one argument, the string naming the local
     file.  It can also be any Lisp form returning a function.  Set
     this to `nil' if you want to always use emacs-w3m to see local
     files.

`w3m-local-find-file-regexps'
     `Cons' of two regexps matching and not matching with local file
     names.  If a url of the `file:' scheme in which you entered
     matches the first form and does not match the latter form, it
     will be opened by the function specified by the
     `w3m-local-find-file-function' variable.  `Nil' for the regexp
     matches any file names.

     For instance, the value `(nil . "\\.html?\\'")' allows
     `file:///some/where/w3m.el', not `file:///any/where/index.html',
     to open by the function specified by
     `w3m-local-find-file-function'.  The latter will be opened as a
     normal web page.

     It is effective only when the `w3m-local-find-file-function'
     variable is set properly.

`w3m-mailto-url-function'
     Function used to handle the `mailto' urls.  Function is called
     with one argument, just a url.  If it is `nil', a function
     specified by the `mail-user-agent' variable will be used for
     composing mail messages.

`w3m-mailto-url-popup-function-alist'
     Alist of `(MAJOR-MODE . FUNCTION)' pairs used to pop a mail
     buffer up.  If a user clicks on a `mailto' url and a mail buffer
     is composed by `mail-user-agent' with the `MAJOR-MODE',
     `FUNCTION' will be called with a mail buffer as an argument.
     Note that the variables `special-display-buffer-names',
     `special-display-regexps', `same-window-buffer-names' and
     `same-window-regexps' will be bound to `nil' while popping to a
     buffer up.

`w3m-make-new-session'
     Non-`nil' means making new emacs-w3m buffers when visiting new
     pages.  If it is non-`nil' and there are already emacs-w3m
     buffers, the `w3m' command makes a new emacs-w3m buffer if a user
     specifies a url string in the minibuffer, and the
     `w3m-safe-view-this-url' command also makes a new buffer if a
     user invokes it in a buffer not being running the `w3m-mode'.
     The default value is `nil'.

`w3m-mbconv-command'
     Name of the `mbconv' command provided by the `libmoe' package.
     The `libmoe' package is used when you use the `w3mmee' command
     instead of the `w3m' command.  See also `w3m-command'.

`w3m-no-proxy-domains'
     List of domain names for which emacs-w3m will not use a proxy
     server.  Each element should be exactly a domain name which means
     the latter common part of the host names, not a regexp.

`w3m-output-coding-system'
     Coding system used when reading from `w3m' processes.

`w3m-pop-up-frames'
     Non-`nil' means pop to a new frame up for an emacs-w3m session.
     This variable is similar to `pop-up-frames' and does override
     `w3m-pop-up-windows'.  If `w3m-use-tab' is non-`nil' or there is
     the buffers selection window (for the `w3m-select-buffer'
     feature), this variable is ignored when creating the second or
     more emacs-w3m session.

`w3m-pop-up-windows'
     Non-`nil' means split the windows when a new emacs-w3m session is
     created.  This variable is similar to `pop-up-windows' and quite
     overridden by `w3m-pop-up-frames' as if `pop-up-frames'
     influences.  Furthermore, if `w3m-use-tab' is non-`nil' or there
     is the buffers selection window (for the `w3m-select-buffer'
     feature), this variable is ignored when creating the second or
     more emacs-w3m session.

`w3m-popup-frame-parameters'
     Alist of frame parameters used when creating a new emacs-w3m
     frame.  It allows not only the alist form but also XEmacs' plist
     form.

`w3m-prefer-cache'
     Non-nil means that cached contents are used without checking
     headers.

`w3m-profile-directory'
     Directory where emacs-w3m config files are loaded from or saved
     to.

`w3m-quick-start'
     Non-`nil' means let emacs-w3m start quickly w/o requiring
     confirmation.  When you invoke the `w3m' command, it attempts to
     visit the page of a string like url around the cursor or the
     value of `w3m-home-page'.  You won't be asked for the
     confirmation then if this value is non-`nil'.  Otherwise, you
     will be prompted for that url with the editing form.

`w3m-redirect-with-get'
     If non-`nil', use the GET method after redirection.  It controls
     how emacs-w3m works when a server responds the code 301 or 302.
     Here is an extract from RFC2616:

     Note: RFC 1945 and RFC 2068 specify that the client is not
     allowed to change the method on the redirected request.  However,
     most existing user agent implementations treat 302 as if it were
     a 303 response, performing a GET on the Location field-value
     regardless of the original request method.

`w3m-relationship-estimate-rules'
     Rules to estimate relationships between a retrieved page and
     others.

`w3m-select-buffer-horizontal-window'
     Non-`nil' means split windows horizontally to open the selection
     window.

`w3m-select-buffer-window-ratio'
     The percentage of the selection window to the whole frame.  The
     car is used when splitting windows horizontally and the cdr is
     for splitting windows vertically.

`w3m-show-decoded-url'
     Non-nil means show decoded URIs in the echo area, the balloon,
     etc.  This variable can take one of the following five kinds of
     forms:

       1. t

          Decode URIs using the encoding assumed by the default
          presumption rule based on the priority list including the
          encoding used to decode the current page and the value of
          `w3m-coding-system-priority-list'.

       2. Coding system

          Decode URIs using this value.

       3. List of coding systems

          Decode URIs using the encoding assumed based on this list.

       4. Alist of predicates and forms described below:

          Each element looks like the `(PREDICATE . ENCODING)' form.
          `PREDICATE' should be a regexp, a function or a Lisp form,
          and `ENCODING' should be one of the forms described here
          excluding this form.  If `PREDICATE' is a regexp, it will be
          tested whether it matches to the current url.  If it is a
          function, it will be called with no argument.  If it is a
          Lisp form, it will be simply evaluated.  Elements are tested
          in turn until the result of the test of the predicate is
          true and the encoding which is associated to the predicate
          is used for decoding URIs.

       5. nil

          Don't decode URIs.

`w3m-show-error-information'
     Non-`nil' means show an error information as a web page.  Page is
     made when the foreign server doesn't respond to a request to
     retrieve data.

`w3m-space-before-favicon'
     String of space char(s) to be put in front of favicon in the
     mode-line.  It may be better to use two or more spaces if you are
     using oblique or italic font in the modeline.

`w3m-space-before-modeline-icon'
     String of space character(s) to be put in front of the modeline
     icon.  It may be better to use one or more spaces if you are
     using oblique or italic font in the modeline.

`w3m-terminal-coding-system'
     Default coding system used when writing to `w3m' processes.  It
     is just a default value to set process' coding system initially.
     (This variable name is analogically derived from the behavior of
     the `w3m' command which accepts data from Emacs just like reads
     from the terminal.)

`w3m-touch-command'
     Name of the executable file of the touch command.  Note that the
     command is required to be able to modify file's timestamp with
     the `-t' option.

`w3m-track-mouse'
     Whether to track the mouse and message the url under the mouse.
     This feature does not work under Emacs or XEmacs versions prior
     to 21.  See also `show-help-function' if you are using Emacs 21
     or later.

     A tip for XEmacs users:

     You can also use the `balloon-help' feature by the `M-x
     balloon-help-mode' command with arg 1.  If the window manager
     decorates the balloon-help frame, and that is not to your taste,
     you may strip it off with the following directives:

          For ol[v]wm use this in .Xdefaults:
             olvwm.NoDecor: balloon-help
               or
             olwm.MinimalDecor: balloon-help

          For fvwm version 1 use this in your .fvwmrc:
             NoTitle balloon-help
          or
             Style "balloon-help" NoTitle, NoHandles, BorderWidth 0

          For twm use this in your .twmrc:
             NoTitle { "balloon-help" }

     See the `balloon-help.el' file for more information.

`w3m-uri-replace-alist'
     Alist of regexps matching URIs, and some types of replacements.
     It can be used universally to replace URI strings in the local
     rule to the valid forms in the Internet.

     Each element looks like the `(REGEXP FUNCTION OPTIONS...)' form.
     `FUNCTION' takes one or more arguments, a uri and `OPTIONS'.  You
     can use the grouping constructs `\\(...\\)' in `REGEXP', and they
     can be referred by the `\N' forms in a replacement (which is one
     of `OPTIONS').

     Here are some predefined functions which can be used for those
     ways:

     `w3m-pattern-uri-replace'
          Replace a URI using PATTERN (which is just an `OPTION').  It
          is allowed that PATTERN contains the `\N' forms in the same
          manner of `replace-match'.

     `w3m-search-uri-replace'
          Generate valid URLs to query words on some specified search
          engines.  For example, the element

               ("\\`gg:" w3m-search-uri-replace "google")

          makes it possible to replace the URI `gg:emacs' to a query
          for the word `emacs' on the Google search engine.

`w3m-url-local-directory-alist'
     Alist of URLs and local directories.  If directory names of a
     given URL and the car of an element are the same, emacs-w3m
     assumes that the file exists in the local directory where the cdr
     of an element points to.  The default value will be set to a
     value of the `yahtml-path-url-alist' variable which exchanged the
     car and the cdr in each element if it is available.

`w3m-use-ange-ftp'
     Non-`nil' means that `ange-ftp' or `efs' is used to access FTP
     servers.

`w3m-use-cygdrive'
     If non-`nil', use the `/cygdrive/' rule when performing
     `expand-file-name'.

`w3m-use-filter'
     Non-`nil' means use filter programs to convert web contents.  See
     also `w3m-filter-rules'.

`w3m-use-form'
     Non-`nil' means make it possible to use form
     extensions. *(EXPERIMENTAL)*

`w3m-use-header-line'
     Non-`nil' means display the header line.

`w3m-use-mule-ucs'
     Non-`nil' means use the multi-script support with Mule-UCS.

`w3m-use-refresh'
     Non-`nil' means honor the REFRESH attribute in META tags.
     Emacs-w3m arbitrarily takes you to a url specified by that
     attribute.  Note that they may be malicious traps.

`w3m-use-symbol'
     Non-`nil' means replace symbols that the `<_SYMBOL>' tags lead
     into.  It is meaningful only when the `w3m-m17n' command is used
     and (X)Emacs handles unicode charsets.

`w3m-use-tab'
     Non-`nil' means make emacs-w3m a tab browser.  It makes it possible
     to show all emacs-w3m buffers in a single window with the tabs line, and
     you can choose one by clicking a mouse on it.  Unfortunately, users of
     Emacs 20 and less cannot enjoy this feature.  See also
     `w3m-use-tab-menubar'.

`w3m-use-tab-menubar'
     Non-`nil' means use the TAB pull-down menu in the menubar.  It
     makes it possible to show all emacs-w3m buffers in a single
     window, and you can choose one by clicking a mouse on it.  This
     feature requires that Emacs has been built to be able to display
     multilingual text in the menubar if you often visit web sites
     written in non-ascii text.  See also `w3m-use-tab'.

`w3m-use-toolbar'
     Non-`nil' activates toolbar of `w3m'.

`w3m-user-agent'
     String used for the User-Agent field.  See also
     `w3m-add-user-agent'.

`w3m-view-this-url-new-session-in-background'
     Run `w3m-view-this-url' without switching to the newly created
     buffer.  It is useful if you enabled the tabs line or the buffers
     selection window for the `w3m-select-buffer' feature.  Note that
     it is meaningful only when specifying a prefix argument to the
     `w3m-view-this-url' command or using the
     `w3m-view-this-url-new-session' command in order to create a new
     emacs-w3m session.



File: emacs-w3m.info, Node: Image Variables, Next: Form Variables, Prev: General Variables, Up: Customizable Variables

Variables related to images
===========================

`w3m-default-display-inline-images'
     Non-`nil' means display images inline in emacs-w3m buffers.  You
     can toggle the visibility of images with the
     `w3m-toggle-inline-images' command.  See also
     `w3m-toggle-inline-images-permanently'.

`w3m-favicon-cache-expire-wait'
     The cache will be expired after specified seconds passed since
     retrieval.  If this variable is `nil', never expired.

`w3m-favicon-cache-file'
     Filename of saving favicon cache.  It defaults to the file named
     `.favicon' under the directory specified by the
     `w3m-profile-directory' variable.

`w3m-favicon-size'
     Size of favicon. This value is used as geometry argument for
     `convert'.

`w3m-favicon-type'
     Image type of display favicon.

`w3m-favicon-use-cache-file'
     If non-`nil', use favicon cache file.

`w3m-icon-directory'
     Directory where emacs-w3m should find icon files.

`w3m-imagick-convert-program'
     Program name of ImageMagick's `convert'.

`w3m-treat-image-size'
     Non-`nil' means let the `w3m' command mind the ratio of the size
     of images and text.  The default value is `t'.

     If it is non-`nil', the `w3m' command will make a `halfdump'
     which reserves rectangle spaces in which images will be put, and
     also `alt' texts will be truncated or padded with spaces so that
     their display width will be the same as the width of images.

     See also `w3m-pixels-per-character' and `w3m-pixels-per-line'.
     Those values will be passed to the `w3m' command in order to
     compute columns and lines which images occupy.

`w3m-pixels-per-character'
     Integer used for the `-ppc' argument of the `w3m' command.  If
     `nil', the width of the default face is used.  It is valid only
     when `w3m-treat-image-size' is non-`nil'.  The default value is
     `nil'.  If you want to use emacs-w3m in a character terminal and
     make `w3m-treat-image-size' effective, you need to set this
     variable properly.

`w3m-pixels-per-line'
     Integer used for the `-ppl' argument of the `w3m' command.  If
     `nil', the height of the default face is used.  It is valid only
     when `w3m-treat-image-size' is non-`nil'.  Note that a small
     value may not induce a good result.  The default value is `64'.
     If you want to use emacs-w3m in a character terminal and make
     `w3m-treat-image-size' effective, you need to set this variable
     properly.

`w3m-resize-image-scale'
     Number of steps in percent used when resizing images.

`w3m-resize-images'
     If non-`nil', resize images to the specified width and height.

`w3m-show-graphic-icons-in-header-line'
     Non-`nil' means show graphic status indicators in the
     header-line.  If it is `nil', also the favicon won't be shown in
     the header-line even if `w3m-use-favicon' is non-`nil'.  This
     variable is currently meaningless under XEmacs.

`w3m-show-graphic-icons-in-mode-line'
     Non-`nil' means show graphic status indicators in the mode-line.
     If it is `nil', also the favicon won't be shown in the mode-line
     even if `w3m-use-favicon' is non-`nil'.

`w3m-toggle-inline-images-permanently'
     Non-`nil' means let the visibility of images continue
     permanently.  The visibility of images is initialized according
     to `w3m-default-display-inline-images' at the first time, and
     except that it may be toggled by the `w3m-toggle-inline-images'
     command, it does not change hereafter, if it is non-`nil'.
     Otherwise, whether images are visible is initialized according to
     `w3m-default-display-inline-images' whenever you visit a new page
     or reload the current page in an emacs-w3m buffer.

`w3m-use-favicon'
     Non-`nil' means show favicon images if they are available.  It
     will be set to `nil' automatically if ImageMagick's `convert'
     program does not support the ico format.

Hooks
=====

`w3m-after-cursor-move-hook'
     Hook run each time after the cursor moves in emacs-w3m buffers.
     This hook is called by the `w3m-check-current-position' function
     by way of `post-command-hook'.

`w3m-delete-buffer-hook'
     Hook run when every emacs-w3m buffer is deleted.

`w3m-display-hook'
     Hook run after displaying pages in emacs-w3m buffers.  Each function is
     called with a url string as the argument.  This hook is evaluated by the
     `w3m-goto-url' function.

`w3m-fontify-after-hook'
     Hook run after fontifying emacs-w3m buffers.  This hook is
     evaluated by the `w3m-fontify' function.

`w3m-fontify-before-hook'
     Hook run when starting to fontify emacs-w3m buffers.  This hook
     is evaluated by the `w3m-fontify' function.

`w3m-form-input-map-mode-hook'
     A hook called after w3m-form-input-map-mode.

`w3m-form-input-map-set-hook'
     A Hook called before w3m-form-input-map-set.

`w3m-form-input-select-mode-hook'
     A hook called after w3m-form-input-select-mode.

`w3m-form-input-select-set-hook'
     A Hook called before w3m-form-input-select-set.

`w3m-form-input-textarea-mode-hook'
     A hook called after w3m-form-input-textarea-mode.

`w3m-form-input-textarea-set-hook'
     A Hook called before w3m-form-input-textarea-set.

`w3m-minor-mode-hook'
     Hook run after `w3m-minor-mode' initialization.

`w3m-mode-hook'
     Hook run after `w3m-mode' initialization.  This hook is evaluated
     by the `w3m-mode' function.

`w3m-select-buffer-hook'
     Hook run when a different emacs-w3m buffer is selected.



File: emacs-w3m.info, Node: Other Variables, Prev: Hooks, Up: Customizable Variables

Other variables
===============

`w3m-async-exec'
     Non-`nil' means execute the `w3m' command asynchronously in Emacs
     process.

`w3m-broken-proxy-cache'
     Set it to `t' if the proxy server seems not to work properly in
     caching.  Note that this may be the double-edged sword; setting
     it to `t' will likely be harmful if the proxy server sends bad
     requests (e.g., not including the Host header, see RFC2616
     section 14.23) to foreign servers when the `w3m' command
     specifies the `no-cache' directive.  Also note that it may not be
     effective if you are using old `w3m' command.

`w3m-history-minimize-in-new-session'
     Non-`nil' means minimize copied history so that there's only
     current page.  This variable is effective when creating of the new
     session by copying (i.e., `w3m-copy-buffer').  The default value is
     `nil'.

`w3m-history-reuse-history-elements'
     Non-`nil' means reuse the history element when re-visiting the
     page.  Otherwise, a new history element will be created even if
     there are elements for the same url in the history.

     Emacs-w3m used to operate as the case in which it is non-`nil',
     however it sometimes brought about users' dissatisfaction.  For
     example, if a user visited the pages A -> B -> C -> B in order,
     performing BACK on the second B would let a user visit A.  The
     reason why a user was taken to A rather than C is that the
     `w3m-history' variable only had the list `(A B C)' as a history
     and B was the current position at that time.

     The default value for this variable is `nil' which allows the
     `w3m-history' variable to have the list `(A B C B)'.  Where
     contents of two B's are the identical Lisp objects.  So, too much
     wasting the Lisp resources will be avoided.

     See the documentation for the variables `w3m-history' and
     `w3m-history-flat' for more information.

`w3m-process-connection-type'
     Value for `process-connection-type' used when communicating with
     `w3m'.

`w3m-process-modeline-format'
     Format used when displaying the progress of the external `w3m'
     process.  It shows a percentage of the data loaded from the web
     server.

`w3m-xmas-show-current-title-in-buffer-tab'
     If non-`nil', show the title strings in the buffers tab.  It has
     no effect if your XEmacs does not support the gutter items.

Hooking emacs-w3m into mail/newsreaders
***************************************

This section introduces three Message User Agents (MUAs).  All those
MUAs can display HTML mails properly using emacs-w3m.  You'll find
here HowTo's and some notes about setting up and using emacs-w3m with
each of these MUAs.

Quick note about the conventions we use: what does `message'
mean?
 When a Gnus user says `message', it often means a draft of
a message to be sent as mail or news.  However, it is the term used by
Mew or Wanderlust users for received mail.  They use `draft' for
the draft of a message to be sent.  On the other hand, a received
message is called an `article' by Gnus users.

* Menu:

* Gnus::                        Reading HTML mails in Gnus

Reading HTML mails in Gnus
==========================

Did you know that Gnus, the Emacs newsreader, supports emacs-w3m?

Actually, the version of Gnus bundled with Emacs does not support
emacs-w3m (yet).  You'd better use the latest version of Gnus.  It is
available at:

`ftp://ftp.gnus.org/pub/gnus/gnus.tar.gz'

Note: if emacs-w3m *is* supported in the Gnus version that comes with
your Emacs distribution, it means either that this documentation is
out-of-date (please report this bug as described in *Note Mailing
List::), or that you're using a very old version of emacs-w3m (in
which case you should update it to a newer version).

   * What can you do with emacs-w3m?

     You can convert HTML spam mails to be human-readable using
     emacs-w3m.  Of course, it works for HTML ham (non-spam) mails as
     well, and for both emacs-w3m is probably faster than the default
     converter.  You don't need to perform any additional operation.
     It will simply be displayed.

     On HTML parts of an article buffer, the `w3m-minor-mode' is
     turned on and you can use the same main keys as the keys of
     emacs-w3m, for instance, RET is for visiting a page which a link
     in the current position points to.  Those keys are defined in the
     `w3m-minor-mode-command-alist' variable.  Keep in mind that some
     commands are replaced by others similar to them, for security
     reasons (see below).

   * What do you have to do?

     Read the Gnus manual (*Note Display Customization:
     (emacs-mime)Display Customization.).  The easiest way is to put
     the following line in your `~/.gnus.el' file:

          (setq mm-text-html-renderer 'w3m)

     Also put the following line if you want to show images inline in
     article buffers:

          (setq mm-inline-text-html-with-images t)

     If you don't need to use emacs-w3m keys in article buffers, add
     the following line too:

          (setq mm-inline-text-html-with-w3m-keymap nil)

   * Notes

     The above description about spam and ham is not for kidding, it's
     just here to get your attention.  Some HTML mails might contain a
     nasty trick used by spammers, using the `<img>' tag which is far
     more evil than the `Click Here!' button.  It is most likely
     intended to check whether the ominous spam mail has reached your
     eyes or not, in which case the spammer knows for sure that your
     email address is valid.  It is done by embedding an identifier
     string into a URL that you might automatically retrieve when
     displaying the image.  If the `mm-w3m-safe-url-regexp' variable
     has not been changed from the default value, Gnus will never
     connect to the spammer's site arbitrarily.

     You can display images inline in an article buffer if you set
     `mm-inline-text-html-with-images' to `t', can't you?  No, not
     exactly: you're still being protected.  If you don't care about leaking
     information (i.e. the fact that your mail address is reachable), set the
     `mm-w3m-safe-url-regexp' variable to `nil'.  The default value
     for `mm-w3m-safe-url-regexp' is `"\\`cid:"' which means we
     consider that images included in a mail with the `cid:' URL are
     safe (that is, you can display such images without modifying the
     `mm-w3m-safe-url-regexp' variable).

   * Giveaway

     Even when you are in the summary buffer, you can toggle
     displaying of images in the article buffer.  It is effective only
     when those images are displayed by emacs-w3m, though.  Here's an
     example:

          (defun gnus-summary-w3m-safe-toggle-inline-images (&optional arg)
            "Toggle displaying of all images in the article buffer.
          If the prefix arg is given, all images are considered to be safe."
            (interactive "P")
            (save-excursion

Reading HTML mails in Mew
=========================

By using emacs-w3m with Mew, you can see HTML mails as it intended to
be displayed.  To do so, put the following line in the `~/.mew.el'
file:

     (require 'mew-w3m)

With just this, an HTML mail will be displayed in the message window
as if it were a plain text.  You can still use the `C-c C-e' command
(`mew-summary-execute-external') there.

It is also quite common these days to see mails containing the same
information twice, they use the `multipart/alternative' format which
consists of both a `text/plain' part and a `text/html' part (what a
waste of bandwidth it is).  Mew displays only the `text/plain' part of
such a mail by default.  However, you perhaps want to see the
`text/html' part since you are using emacs-w3m.  If so, add the
following lines to the `~/.mew.el' file:

     (setq mew-mime-multipart-alternative-list
           '("Text/Html" "Text/Plain" ".*"))

There are some customizable variables related to Mew:

`mew-use-w3m-minor-mode'
     If non-`nil', the `w3m-minor-mode' is turned on in the message
     buffer where a text/html part is displayed, and you can use the
     same main keys as the keys of emacs-w3m, for instance, RET is for
     visiting a page which a link in the current position points to.
     Those keys are defined in the `w3m-minor-mode-command-alist'
     variable.  Keep in mind that some commands are replaced by others
     similar to them, for security reasons.  The default value is
     `nil'.

`mew-w3m-auto-insert-image'
     If non-`nil', you can see images inline in the message buffer
     when you read a multipart/related message.  Note that mew-w3m
     only allows images contained in the message body with a `cid:'
     URL to be displayed (as we consider them safe).  The default
     value is `nil'.

     To activate this feaeture, add following in your `~/.mew.el'.

          (define-key mew-summary-mode-map "T" 'mew-w3m-view-inline-image)

     Press "T", toggle the visibility of the images included its
     message only.  Press "C-uT", display the all images included its
     Text/Html part."

`mew-w3m-cid-retrieve-hook'
     A hook run just after retrieving a `cid:' URL.  The default value
     is `nil'.

Reading HTML mails in SEMI MUAs
===============================

You can display HTML mails as human-readable, using emacs-w3m and SEMI
MUAs, for example, Wanderlust, T-gnus, etc.  Since those MUAs depend
on SEMI (and also FLIM) for MIME functions, we generically call them
SEMI MUAs.  Although SEMI uses Emacs/W3 for rendering HTML mails by
default, it can easily be altered to emacs-w3m and it will make your
cyber life still more comfortable.

You simply need to put the following line in `~/.emacs' file:

     (require 'mime-w3m)

The `mime-w3m' and `mime-w3' modules are functionally alike, as you
might have guessed (see how the names sound alike?).  The latter is
included in the SEMI package.

On HTML parts of an article buffer, the `w3m-minor-mode' is turned on
and you can use the same main keys as the keys of emacs-w3m, for
instance, RET is for visiting a page which a link in the current
position points to.  Those keys are defined in the
`w3m-minor-mode-command-alist' variable.  Keep in mind that some
commands are replaced by others similar to them, for security reasons.

There are some customizable variables related to the `mime-w3m'
module:

`mime-w3m-display-inline-images'
     If it is non-`nil', images will be displayed inline in HTML
     mails.  If it is the symbol `default' (which is the default) at
     the first time, the value of this variable will be replaced with
     the value of the `w3m-default-display-inline-images' variable.
     You probably don't need to change this.

`mime-w3m-safe-url-regexp'
     Regexp matching URLs which are considered to be safe.  The
     default value is `"\\`cid:"' which means we consider that images
     included in a mail with the `cid:' URLs are safe.  See also *Note
     Gnus:: about rogue attacks.

`mime-w3m-setup-hook'
     A hook run just after setting up the cooperation of the
     `mime-w3m' module and SEMI.  The default value is `nil'.

By the way, even when you are in the summary buffer, you can toggle
displaying of images in the article buffer (which is what is called
the message buffer in the Wanderlust community).  It is effective only
when those images are displayed by emacs-w3m, though.  Here're
examples for T-gnus, Nana-gnus and Wanderlust:

     ;; T-gnus or Nana-gnus:
     (defun gnus-summary-w3m-safe-toggle-inline-images (&optional arg)
       "Toggle displaying of all images in the article buffer.
     If the prefix arg is given, all images are considered to be safe."
       (interactive "P")
       (save-excursion
         (set-buffer gnus-article-buffer)
         (w3m-safe-toggle-inline-images arg)))

     (eval-after-load "gnus-sum"
       '(define-key gnus-summary-mode-map
          "\C-i" 'gnus-summary-w3m-safe-toggle-inline-images))

     ;; Wanderlust:
     (defun wl-summary-w3m-safe-toggle-inline-images (&optional arg)
       "Toggle displaying of all images in the message buffer.
     If the prefix arg is given, all images are considered to be safe."
       (interactive "P")
       (save-excursion
         (set-buffer wl-message-buffer)
         (w3m-safe-toggle-inline-images arg)))

     (eval-after-load "wl-summary"
       '(define-key wl-summary-mode-map
          "\M-i" 'wl-summary-w3m-safe-toggle-inline-images))

See also *Note Nnshimbun:: if you are using T-gnus or Nana-gnus.

VM (vieW maiL) is not Wanderlust
================================

Emacs-w3m is not supporting VM positively.  It is simply because there
is no VM user in the emacs-w3m team.  However, don't be pessimistic.
There is the `vm-w3m.el' module in the attic directory of the
emacs-w3m distribution.  You are a lucky person if it is helpful to
you.  Try it anyhow.  You can find how to use it in the file itself.

If you want to toggle displaying of images in the presentation buffer
when you are in any VM buffer, use the following:

     (define-key vm-mode-map "T" 'vm-w3m-safe-toggle-inline-images)

General Questions
=================

   * Q. What's emacs-w3m?

     It is an interface program on Emacs which controls w3m.  For more
     information, see *Note Introduction::.

   * Q. Which emacs versions are supported?

     The following Emacsen have been checked for emacs-w3m support:

        * Mule 2.3 (based on Emacs 19.34)
        * Emacs 19.34
        * Emacs 20
        * Emacs 21
        * Emacs 22
        * XEmacs 21.1 with Mule
        * XEmacs 21.2 with Mule (beta37 or greater)
        * XEmacs 21.4 with/without Mule
        * XEmacs 21.5 with/without Mule
        * Meadow

     Note that you're required to use APEL if you'd like to run
     emacs-w3m under Mule 2.3, Emacs 19.34 or XEmacs.  For more
     information, see *Note Other Requirements::.

     Emacs-w3m works on Emacs 19.34 or XEmacs without the Mule feature
     except for several commands, such as the command to look weather
     forecasts in Japan.  They strongly depends on the Mule feature,
     so that they must not work on Emacs 19.34 or XEmacs without Mule.

   * Q. Which w3m versions are supported?

     The following w3m versions have been checked for emacs-w3m
     support:

        * w3m-0.3 and later
        * w3mmee-p24-18 + moe-1.5.4

          Note that w3mmee mentioned as the example is configured with
          the `lang=many' option (it can be done by entering 3, when
          the `configure' script prompts you, "Which language do you
          prefer?").  It also requires the `libmoe' package.

   * Q. I've already installed APEL in the XEmacs SUMO package, is it
     ok?

     There are some problems in the XEmacs APEL package (all modules
     have been compiled for XEmacs with Mule); for instance, the
     `std11' modules conflict with the FLIM's one, etc.  Even though
     you can use `apel-1.23-pkg.tar.gz' or later for both XEmacs with
     Mule and non-Mule XEmacs if you don't use FLIM for the `shimbun'
     features, we recommend you replace it or newly install the
     original APEL package.  See *Note Other Requirements:: where to
     get it from.

   * Q. I've gotten the developing version of emacs-w3m with CVS,
     however I'm missing `configure' script.

     It is necessary to run `autoconf' first, to generate
     `configure' script.



File: emacs-w3m.info, Node: Trouble FAQ, Next: Shimbun FAQ, Prev: General FAQ, Up: Frequently Asked Questions

Troubleshooting
===============

   * Q. Why can't I enter a password on pages which require
     authentication?

     Make sure the `w3m-async-exec' variable is set to a value other
     than `nil'.

   * Q. Why can't I enter a password for a proxy server which requires
     authentication?

     Make sure the `w3m-async-exec' variable is set to a value other
     than `nil'.

   * Q. Why can't I follow links?

     Emacs-w3m requires a version of w3m which recognizes the
     `-header' option.  Check what version of w3m you use.

   * Q. Why do garbage characters appear?

     It could be caused by the following reasons:

       1. Bad HTML file

          If the character set specified by the `<meta>' tag differs
          from the actual contents in an HTML file, it will not be
          displayed correctly.  Use the command `M-x
          w3m-redisplay-with-charset' or `C c' to set the correct
          character set and to force redisplay of the page.

       2. Limitation of the character sets

          A page written by a character set other than
          ISO-2022-JP(jis), EUC-JP, or SHIFT_JIS may not be displayed
          correctly.  Try one of the following ways:

            a. Any characters defined in Unicode will be displayed
               correctly if you install the Mule-UCS package (*Note
               Other Requirements::).  You need to make sure that the
               value of the `w3m-use-mule-ucs' variable is set to a
               value other than `nil' after installing the Mule-UCS
               package.  In addition, if you want to make Emacs (and
               also emacs-w3m) handle the character sets EUC-JISX0213
               and ISO-2022-JP-3, you have to install the `jisx0213'
               module which is contained in the Mule-UCS package
               (though it doesn't work under XEmacs unfortunately).

            b. Install w3mmee or w3m-m17n, and set the `w3m-command'
               variable to the appropriate value.  And emacs-w3m will
               use the multi-lingual features provided by one of those
               programs.  However, a page written by a coding system
               which Emacs doesn't support may not be displayed
               correctly. So please install Mule-UCS package if
               necessary.

       3. Emacsen incompatibility

          Under XEmacs 21.1, pages written by the SHIFT_JIS character
          set may not be displaied correctly.  There is also a problem
          in XEmacs 21.2 prior to the beta 36 version.  You should
          upgrade your XEmacs if you use such one.

          You should notice that XEmacs versions 21.1 and 21.2 have
          already been retired officially.

       4. Don't use `standard-display-european'

          It is generally harmful since it often makes Latin
          characters get displayed incorrectly.  For instance, the
          apostrophe character (`'') which was encoded as `&#8217'
          will be displayed as the character `u' with a grave accent
          as if it had been encoded as `&#249'.  If the line something
          like the following is in your `~/.emacs' file or site files
          which Emacs loads when starting up, we strongly recommend
          you to remove it.

               (standard-display-european 1)

          There the argument might be `t', not `1'.

   * Q. Why can't images be shown?

     It could be caused by the following reasons:

     There is a bug in the earlier versions of the `libungif' library.
     You have to install `libungif-4.1.0b1' and later.

     You must install the `gifsicle' program if you want to run
     emacs-w3m under XEmacs.  *Note Other Requirements::.

     Emacs-w3m doesn't support the old versions of w3m.  Check what
     version of w3m you use.

   * Q. Why can't I browse pages which require cookies?

     (This is still an experimental feature.)

     Make sure the `w3m-use-cookies' variable is set to a value other
     than `nil'.

   * Q. Why can't I fill in the form?

     (This is still an experimental feature.)

     Make sure the `w3m-use-form' variable is set to a value other than
     `nil'.

   * Q. Why can't I submit a form?

     (This is still an experimental feature.)

     Make sure the `w3m-use-form' variable is set to a value other
     than `nil'.  You also need to use a version of w3m which
     recognizes the `-post' option in order to use this function.
     Check what version of w3m you use.

   * Q. Why are frames not rendered?

     Install w3mmee and put the following line in your `~/.emacs'
     file:

          (setq w3m-command "w3mmee")

   * Q. Why are favicon images not displayed in the Emacs 21 tab bar?

     Install the `convert' program which is included in ImageMagick.
     It is available from: `http://www.imagemagick.org/'

   * Q. Why does Emacs 21 get locked when a favicon image is going to
     be displayed?
   * Q. My computer accesses the disk drive violently and says
     `process convert exited abnormally with code 10'.  What's the
     story?

     Do you use an old version of ImageMagick?  As far as we know, it
     happens when you use the `convert' program bundled with
     ImageMagick 5.2.1.  It has been confirmed that the `convert'
     program bundled with ImageMagick 5.4.0-5 (and later) works fine.

     If you don't want to use ImageMagick, or if you can't use its
     most recent version, add the following line in your
     `~/.emacs-w3m' file:

          (setq w3m-use-favicon nil)

   * Q. Why does not emacs-w3m work with w3mmee?

     If you are using w3mmee configured with the option `lang=en' or
     `lang=ja', reconfigure w3mmee with the option `lang=many' (it can
     be done by entering 3, when the `configure' script prompts you,
     Which language do you prefer?"), and rebuild w3mmee.

   * Q. Why I cannot visit web pages using emacs-w3m?  There is no
     problem when visiting local html files or using w3m barefoot,
     though.

     What is called the asynch patch (1) (*Note Trouble
     FAQ-Footnotes::) is applied to the w3m command which some Linux
     distribution (e.g. Gentoo Linux) contains.  It is useful when
     using w3m barefoot, however it might make emacs-w3m hang.  If it
     is suspected, we recommend you reinstall the w3m command from the
     original source.

Questions of Shimbun Library
============================

   * Q. Why are the `shimbun' modules not installed?

     Note that the `shimbun' modules (files under the `shimbun/'
     directory) won't be installed if the FLIM package has not been
     installed in your system.

     The `configure' script determines automatically whether the FLIM
     package is installed or not.  If the FLIM package is installed in
     a non-standard directory, the determination fails.  In this case,
     you can use the `--with-addpath' configure option to explicitly
     set the directory name where the FLIM package has been installed.
     Here's an example:

          % ./configure --with-addpath=$HOME/share/emacs/site-lisp/flim

A tool for reading a newspaper
******************************

More and more newspapers, mailing list archives, bulletin boards, and
individual diaries (such as hyper nikki system, weblogs and blogs) are
published on the web.  `Shimbun' library enables you to read those
contents with your favorite mail/news reader.  Actually, `Shimbun'
library provides functions to convert those contents into articles
like common e-mails.

     `Shimbun' is pronounced "she-n-boon" (but actually vowels
     shouldn't be prolonged), it means "newspaper" in Japanese.

`Shimbun' library currently supports Asahi Shimbun, Yomiuri
On-line, many maling list archives such as Emacs Devel, XEmacs Beta,
Gnus, Mew, and Wanderlust, the Japanese Prime Minister Koizumi's mail
magazine, Slashdot Japan, and a lot of others.  For more detail, see
*Note Shimbun Sites::.

By the way, you have to pay attention to copyright when using
`Shimbun' library.  Copyrights of articles generated with `Shimbun'
library are reserved by copyright holders of those original contents.
Therefore, you are obliged not to violate rights of copyright holders,
when you enjoy generated articles.  It means that you can enjoy
generated articles on "fair use" that is described in the copyright
law.

We, emacs-w3m development team, give no warranty to you, if `Shimbun'
library causes a damage to you, or if you face a lawsuit about
violation of copyrights.

`Shimbun' library is a collection of many modules, but each of them
serves no useful purpose alone.  This section explains three typical
`Shimbun' applications (two of which are included in the `Shimbun'
library) and how to make `Shimbun' modules by yourself (you need to be
able to write Emacs Lisp programs).

Turning Gnus into a web browser!
================================

`Nnshimbun' is a Gnus back end, but it is distributed with emacs-w3m,
not Gnus, exceptionally.  `Nnshimbun' allows you to turn Gnus into an
exceptionally useful web browser.  You can skim through the articles
on a newspaper's web server without having to see all the
advertisement.  You can read articles in mailing list archives as if
you were subscribed to the list.  You can also read submissions in
bulletin boards, etc...  Note that if you want to followup, you still
need to use emacs-w3m as Gnus can't post via the web with `nnshimbun'.

See also *Note Gnus:: for rendering HTML messages with emacs-w3m if
you use Gnus, see *Note SEMI MUAs:: for T-gnus or Nana-gnus instead.

The easiest way to get started with `nnshimbun' is to use something
like the following in the Group buffer:

`M-x gnus-group-make-shimbun-group RET asahi RET national RET'

Replace `asahi' and `national' with the keyword corresponding
to the server you'd like to connect to and the group you're interested
in respectively.  You can complete both of those names by using
TAB or SPC.

You can also bind that to a key if there's enough room in the
`gnus-group-mode-map' map, you can add something like the following in
your `~/.gnus.el' file (T-gnus users, you don't need to bother to add
it, since there's already the similar thing in T-gnus):

     (eval-after-load "gnus-group"
       '(define-key gnus-group-mode-map "Gn"
          'gnus-group-make-shimbun-group))

Then, you can use `G n' instead of `M-x
gnus-group-make-shimbun-group'.

*Could someone book this keystroke at the Gnus Tower?*


`Nnshimbun' simply fetches HTML contents from the web server and
displays them as an article, but it will never save articles in the
local file system, except if you use persistent articles
(*Note Persistent Articles: (gnus)Persistent Articles.).  `Nnshimbun' uses NOV files for each
`nnshimbun' group, and its back end is almost the same as
`nnml'.

The following `nnshimbun' variables can be customized:

`nnshimbun-keep-backlog'
     This variable overrides the `gnus-keep-backlog' variable (*Note
     Article Backlog: (gnus)Article Backlog.) in `nnshimbun' groups.
     If you set `nnshimbun-keep-backlog' to a number N, `nnshimbun'
     will store at most N old articles in a buffer for later
     re-fetching.  If this variable is non-`nil' and is not a number,
     `nnshimbun' will store *all* read articles (this is not a good
     idea).  The default value is 300.

     Note that smaller values may spoil the `prefetch-articles'
     feature (see below), since `nnshimbun' uses the backlog to keep
     the prefetched articles.

`nnshimbun-directory'
     Directory where `nnshimbun' saves NOV files.  The default value
     is `~/News/shimbun/'.

You can use the specially made group parameter for `nnshimbun' in
addition to the standard group parameters provided by Gnus (1) (*Note
Nnshimbun-Footnotes::).  Several parameters for `nnshimbun' are
collected into the single group parameter `nnshimbun-group-parameters'
which is a property list (the values can be different for every
group).  Here's an example:

     '(index-range all prefetch-articles off encapsulate-images on
                   expiry-wait 6)

Below is the documentation for those group parameters and related
variables.

`prefetch-articles'
     In a group where this group parameter is set to something else
     than `off' or `nil', `nnshimbun' not only checks for new
     articles, but also downloads them.  Though it will slow checking
     of new articles down, you won't be kept waiting when reading
     articles.  In the group where this group parameter is not set or
     its value is `nil', the value of the
     `nnshimbun-pre-fetch-article' variable (`off' by default) is used
     instead.

`encapsulate-images'
     In a group where this group parameter is set to something else than
     `off' or `nil', `nnshimbun' will put image data embedded
     in the original contents into an article as `multipart/related'
     parts of the MIME format.  In the group where this group parameter is
     not set or its value is `nil', the value of the
     `nnshimbun-encapsulate-images' variable is used instead.  The
     default value for the `nnshimbun-encapsulate-images' variable is
     the value of the `shimbun-encapsulate-images' variable which is
     provided in the `shimbun' library (the default value is probably
     `t').

`index-range'
     You can specify the range of articles to be fetched from the web
     server using the `index-range' group parameter.  To specify the
     range, use the following values:

     `nil'
     `all'
          all pages

     `last'
          only the latest page

     `integer N'
          the latest N pages

     `Nnshimbun' checks whether there are new articles by parsing the
     index page of the server.  It is possible that there are two or
     more index pages on the server.  For instance, in the case of the
     mailing list servers, index pages are generally classified
     according to the date on which the article was posted.  It would
     take a considerable amount of time to check all those huge index
     pages especially if you are connecting via a slow line.

     If it is possible, `nnshimbun' won't check index pages which have
     already been checked at the last connection.  If you want to save
     even more time, use `last'.  It makes `nnshimbun' refer to only
     the latest index page for checking new articles.

     In the group where the `index-range' group parameter is not set
     or its value is `nil', the value of the `nnshimbun-index-range'
     variable (`nil' by default) is used.

`nnshimbun-group-parameters-alist'
     This is an Emacs Lisp variable, an alist of regexp of group names
     and `nnshimbun' group parameters.  The default value is `nil'.
     Each element may have the form `(REGEXP KEYWORD VALUE KEYWORD
     VALUE...)', for example:

          '("^nnshimbun\\+asahi:" index-range all prefetch-articles off
            encapsulate-images on expiry-wait 6)

     Since you can use this variable to specify the same `nnshimbun'
     group parameters for two or more groups which have similar names
     (i.e., those groups are likely to have similar characteristics
     each other), it is useful that it can be used instead of
     specifying the `nnshimbun' group parameters to several groups
     respectively.  If the group parameter has already been set in a
     group, that takes precedence over this variable.

You can instruct `nnshimbun' to expire articles (2) (*Note
Nnshimbun-Footnotes::).  Keep in mind that when an article is expired,
it is not deleted from the remote server, it's still available there.
What is deleted is the line in your own NOV file for `nnshimbun' (3)
(*Note Nnshimbun-Footnotes::) corresponding to the article to be
expired.  Then the article won't appear in the Summary buffer, forever
and ever.

If you don't expire articles in `nnshimbun' groups, the NOV files will
continue to grow fat indefinitely and you may see very old articles in
the Summary buffer as if they were existing (in fact, they might have
expired three years ago on the remote server!).  Even if you try to
read such an article, nothing will appear in the article buffer.  On
the other hand, most mailing list servers generally offer all the past
articles.  You may not feel like expiring articles in such groups in
order to look back with nostalgia to the good old days and to be able
to read, eyes filled with tears, articles which you thought long gone.

You can mark `nnshimbun' articles as expirable and specify the
expiry period in each `nnshimbun' group as well as the other mail
back ends.  However, there are a little differences between
`nnshimbun' and the other mail back ends:

   * First of all, the expiry period is determined with the following
     priorities.  Note that the default value might be different from
     group to group.

       1. The value of the `expiry-wait' group parameter in a group.

       2. The value produced by evaluating the
          `nnmail-expiry-wait-function' variable for a group.

       3. The default value provided by the `shimbun' module
          corresponding to a group.

       4. The value of the `nnmail-expiry-wait' variable.

   * Second of all, the argument to be passed to the function
     specified by the `nnmail-expiry-wait-function' variable will
     contain the names of the back end and the server like
     nnshimbun+asahi:national", while only the group name will be
     given in the case of the other mail back ends.  Here's an
     example:

          (setq nnmail-expiry-wait-function
                (lambda (group)
                  (cond ((string-equal group "ding") 7)
                        ((string-equal group "nnshimbun+ding:ding") 'never))))

     This means that there are two groups for the same ding mailing
     list; one is subscribed as a list member, the other is for
     reading from the mailing list archive at the Gnus Towers.  Ahem,
     isn't it clever?  The local mail files in the "ding" group will
     be expired in seven days and your local disk space will be saved,
     but you can read even the articles of the last century in the
     second group (if it is really needed, though).

   * Third of all, and this is written down so that you can remember
     it when you're filled with doubt: even when all articles from a
     `nnshimbun' group should be expired, the most recent one will be
     kept.  This is not to satisfy your indecisive heart, it's because
     the next time you fetch new articles for this group, `nnshimbun'
     will know where to begin and not fetch all the articles all over
     again.

The group parameters and the variables related to expiring
`nnshimbun' articles are:

`expiry-wait'
     Don't be confused, please.  The `expiry-wait' group parameter is
     provided as one of the elements of `nnshimbun-group-parameters',
     the specially made group parameter for `nnshimbun'.  It has the
     same name and the same meaning as the standard group parameter.
     You may use whichever you like.  If nnshimbun's one is set to
     non-`nil' value, it takes precedence over the standard one.  It
     is provided in order to concentrate things related to `nnshimbun'
     at one place of the "Gnus Customize" buffer (which will appear by
     typing `G c' in the group buffer) and to realize managing
     collectively by the `nnshimbun-group-parameters-alist' variable
     (4) (*Note Nnshimbun-Footnotes::).  The values which can be used
     are a number of expiry period, `never' or `immediate' as well as
     the standard group parameter.

`nnshimbun-keep-unparsable-dated-articles'
     If this variable is non-`nil', the articles of which the time of
     creation (or the time of arrival) is unknown will never be
     expired, since their age is unknown.  The default is `t'.  If you
     set this variable to `nil', the articles of which the time is
     unknown will also be expired unconditionally when the time to
     expire has come.  Well, it might prove useful for a general
     cleaning at the end of a year.


File: emacs-w3m.info  Node: Nnshimbun-Footnotes, Up: Nnshimbun

(1) The easiest way to specify group parameters is to type `G c'
in the group buffer after moving the point to the group you'd like to
customize (*Note Group Parameters: (gnus)Group Parameters.).

(2) There are mainly two ways to expire articles automatically in the
`nnshimbun' groups.  One is to add a group name regular
expression (it should begin with "^nnshimbun\\+") to the
`gnus-auto-expirable-newsgroups' variable and to put the expiry
period for each group into the `nnmail-expiry-wait-function'
variable.  Another is to set the `auto-expire' group parameter to
`t' and to set the expiry period with the `expiry-wait'
group parameter in every `nnshimbun' group which you want to
expire automatically.  See *Note (gnus)Expiring Mail:: for more
information.  In the group to which the `expiry-wait' group
parameter is not specified, a default expiry period will be applied.

(3) The NOV file for `nnshimbun' is named something
like "~/News/shimbun/asahi/national/.overview".

(4) We've already prepared the answer to the question that why
`auto-expire' etc. aren't included in the nnshimbun's
special group parameter?  The answer is, `expiry-wait' is
handled by the `nnshimbun' back end, but `auto-expire'
is handled by the Gnus core.  Therefore, it is contrary to the
design policy of Gnus to extend the Gnus core functions so that
it may work for one particular back end (i.e. reading a value
from the nnshimbun's special group parameter).

Reading web newspapers with Mew
===============================

Mew Shimbun is an Emacs Lisp program meant to be used with `shimbun'
and Mew (version 2.1 and later).  The `mew-shimbun' module will be
installed together with emacs-w3m if Mew, APEL, and FLIM are also
installed.

We recommend you also see *Note Mew::.

  1. Setting things up

     Put the following lines in the last of the `~/.mew.el' file:

     ;;; Loading mew-shimbun, defining keys.  ;; (setq
     mew-shimbun-use-unseen t) ;;; (1) (*Note Mew Shimbun-Footnotes::)
     (require 'mew-shimbun) (define-key mew-summary-mode-map "G"
     (make-sparse-keymap)) (define-key mew-summary-mode-map "Gg"
     'mew-shimbun-goto-folder) (define-key mew-summary-mode-map "GG"
     'mew-shimbun-goto-unseen-folder) (define-key mew-summary-mode-map
     Gi" 'mew-shimbun-retrieve) (define-key mew-summary-mode-map "GI"
     'mew-shimbun-retrieve-all) (define-key mew-summary-mode-map "Gr"
     'mew-shimbun-re-retrieve) (define-key mew-summary-mode-map "GR"
     'mew-shimbun-re-retrieve-all) (define-key mew-summary-mode-map
     Ge" 'mew-shimbun-expire) (define-key mew-summary-mode-map "GE"
     'mew-shimbun-expire-all)

     ;; Specifying `shimbun' servers and groups to be read with Mew in the
     ;; `mew-shimbun-folder-groups' variable.  Each element has the form
     ;; `("folder" ("server.group" . range) ...)'.  You can use `all',
     ;; `last', and a number for the `range' item.

     (setq mew-shimbun-folder-groups
           '(;; Fetching `yomiuri.shakai', `yomiuri.sports', etc.
             ;; into the `+shimbun/yomiuri' folder collectively.
             ("yomiuri"
              ("yomiuri.shakai" . 2)
              ("yomiuri.sports". 2)
              ("yomiuri.kokusai". 2))
             ;; Fetching `security-memo.memo'
             ;; into `+shimbun/security-memo'.
             ("security-memo"
              ("security-memo.memo" . 2))
             ("slashdot-jp"
              ("slashdot-jp.story" . last))
             ;; You can read several groups in one folder (`+shimbun/emacs')
             ;; as follows even if each group comes from a different server.
             ("emacs"
              ("airw.wl" . last)
              ("emacs-w3m.emacs-w3m" . last))
             ;; Fetching diaries into `+shimbun/hns/arisawa' and
             ;; `+shimbun/hns/miyoshi' respectively.
             ("hns/arisawa"
              ("hns.arisawa" . last))
             ("hns/miyoshi"
              ("hns.miyoshi" . last))))

     You did the fundamental setups.  For the other user definable
     variables, use `M-x customize-group' for the `mew-shimbun' group
     or see the source code.

  2. Reading `shimbun' messages

       a. Getting started

          Type `G I' (`mew-shimbun-retrieve-all') first, after setting
          things up as mentioned above.  The `shimbun' folders specified by
          the `mew-shimbun-folder-groups' variable will be created under the
          `+shimbun' parent folder.  Typing `G I' is also useful when you
          have added new groups.  You can change the name of the parent folder
          (`+shimbun' by default) by customizing the
          `mew-shimbun-folder' variable.

       b. Moving into a `shimbun' folder

          You can move to any folder (including `shimbun') by typing
          `g' (`mew-summary-goto-folder'), but `G g'
          (`mew-shimbun-goto-folder') is restricted to moving to only
          the `shimbun' folder.  In addition, folders which have new
          messages (in other words, folders which have not been
          scanned) will be displayed when using a prefix argument with
          `G g' (i.e. `C-u G g').  A prefix argument similarly affects
          `G G' as well.

       c. Fetching messages in each folder

          You can fetch new messages for the current folder exclusively by typing
          `G i' (`mew-shimbun-retrieve') in a `shimbun' folder.

       d. Fetching updated messages

          If you perform the `G r' command (`mew-shimbun-re-retrieve')
          when a particular message is being displayed, the message
          will be updated if it is possible, and new messages will be
          fetched.  With a prefix argument (i.e. `C-u G r'), it will
          attempt to update messages which are marked with the mark
          specified by the `mew-shimbun-mark-re-retrieve' variable
          (`@' by default).  It would be useful for CNET, etc.

          The `G R' command (`mew-shimbun-re-retrieve-all') checks the
          freshness of all messages and re-fetches the updated
          messages.  If a prefix argument is given (i.e. `C-u G R'),
          the messages within the region will be processed.  It is
          probably worthwhile if the site is running the hyper nikki
          system (`nikki' means "diary" in Japanese).

  3. Managing unseen messages

     If you have the following setting in the `~/.mew.el' file,

          (setq mew-shimbun-use-unseen t)

     newly fetched messages will be marked with the mark specified by
     the `mew-shimbun-mark-unseen' variable (`*' by default), and it
     will disappear automatically after reading the message.

     Normally, the unseen marks will not be saved in the `.mew-cache'
     file if scanning is not performed after adding or deleting marks in the
     Mew summary mode, but if you add the following line to the
     `~/.mew.el' file,

          (setq mew-shimbun-use-unseen-cache-save t)

     the unseen marks will be saved in the `.mew-cache' file
     automatically for the `shimbun' groups when exiting Mew or
     killing a folder (using `C-c C-q').  However, it is not securely
     saved (2) (*Note Mew Shimbun-Footnotes::).  To do this securely,
     you had better have the habit of performing the `scan update'
     command after reading the folder.

     If you don't like the `*' mark for unseen messages, customize the
     `mew-shimbun-mark-unseen' variable (see above).  By specifying
     the mark by `C-u N', you will be able to lead a better life with
     taking care of unseen messages.

  4. Expiring messages

     You can expire messages if you set the `mew-shimbun-expires'
     variable beforehand.  For example:

          (setq mew-shimbun-expires
                '(("yomiuri" . 7)
                  ("asahi" . 1)
                  ("slashdot-jp" . 7)
                  ("emacs" . 7)))

     If you set this variable as shown above, you can specify the
     expiry period; 7 days for `+shimbun/yomiuri', 1 day for
     `+shimbun/asahi'.  Messages in the `shimbun' folder where the
     expiry period is not specified will never be expired.  You can
     use the `G e' command (`mew-shimbun-expire') to expire the
     expirable messages in the current folder.  The `G E' command
     (`mew-shimbun-expire-all') is for expiring the expirable messages
     in all the `shimbun' folders.  Note that once the messages have
     been expired, you cannot recover them.

  5. How to mark messages with `$' as unseen

     Put the following lines in the `~/.mew.el' file in order to
     define the `$' mark and use `$' for the mark of unseen.  See
     `http://www.mew.org/ml/mew-dist-2.0/msg01251.html' if you would
     like to replace the `$' mark with another.

     ;;----------------------------------------------------------------------
     ;;; Code for using `$' as the unseen mark.
     (setq mew-mark-unseen ?$)
     (setq mew-shimbun-mark-unseen mew-mark-unseen)
     (setq mew-mark-show-list (cons mew-mark-unseen mew-mark-show-list))
     (setq mew-mark-afterstep-spec
           (cons (cons mew-mark-unseen '(1 0 1 0 0 0 0))
                 mew-mark-afterstep-spec))
     (setq mew-mark-spec
           (cons (list mew-mark-unseen "unseen" 0 nil nil nil nil nil)
                 mew-mark-spec))
     (setq mew-highlight-mark-keywords
           (cons
            (cons mew-mark-unseen 'mew-face-mark-unseen)
            mew-highlight-mark-keywords))
     (defface mew-face-mark-unseen
       '((((class color) (type tty))
          (:foreground "green"))
         (((class color) (background light))
          (:foreground "deep pink" :bold t :italic t))
         (((class color) (background dark))
          (:foreground "thistle"))
         (t (:bold t)))
       "*Face to highlight the unseen mark"
       :group 'mew-highlight)
     (defun mew-summary-unseen (&optional count)
       "Put the unseen mark(default is '$') in COUNT times."
       (interactive "P")
       (mew-mark-put-mark-loop (function mew-summary-unseen-one) count nil))
     (defun mew-summary-unseen-one (&optional no-msg)
       "Put the unseen mark(default is '$') on this message."

     (defun mew-thread-mark-unseen ()
       "Put the '$' mark on all messages of the current sub-thread."
       (interactive)
       (mew-thread-mark mew-mark-unseen))

     (define-key mew-summary-mode-map "$"  'mew-summary-unseen)

It must be placed before the `(require 'mew-shimbun)' line.

(2) People who have set the `mew-touch-folder-p' variable to

     These backends generates articles including only texts; in other
     hands, `asahi-html' generates MIME articles that include texts
     and photographs.  In order to use the latter backend, specify
     asahi-html.business instead of asahi.business as the group name.
     Especially, it is recommended to use `asahi-html' in order to see
     the groups in which there are pictures.

How to make a new shimbun module
================================

`Shimbun' is a library set of emacs-w3m that enables you to read
certain web contents using Gnus, Wanderlust, or Mew as if they were
email messages.  Here we will explain how to make a new `shimbun'
module.

File: emacs-w3m.info, Node: Overview, Next: Getting web page and header information, Prev: Shimbun Basics, Up: Shimbun Basics

Overview
--------

When you make a new `shimbun' module `foobar' for reading
contents of `http://www.foobar.net', what you have to do first is
to put the following S expressions in the first part of the
`sb-foobar.el' file:

     (require 'shimbun)
     (luna-define-class shimbun-foobar (shimbun) ())

We will explain what they are below, so you can understand they are just
incantations now.  You have to use the same suffix `foobar' in the
file name (`sb-foobar.el') and the class name
(`shimbun-foobar') as the second argument for the
`luna-define-class' macro.

Major jobs of the `shimbun-foobar' module can be classified broadly
into the following four categories (note that you may rephrase
folder" with "group" if you are a Gnus user):

  1. Getting a page source from `http://www.foobar.net' in order to
     gather articles' subjects etc. when a MUA opens the `foobar'
     folder.

  2. Gathering subjects and other necessary informations from the page
     source in order to make headlines of articles and returning them
     as the structured list called `headers'.

  3. Getting a page source for an article from the web site, for
     example, `http://www.foobar.net/053003.html', when MUA requires
     to display an article in the `foobar' folder, and

  4. Removing cruft, e.g. advertisements, from the page source and
     formatting a raw article.

`shimbun-headers' of `shimbun.el' does the first job,
`shimbun-get-headers' does the second, `shimbun-article' does the
third and `shimbun-make-contents' does the last.

The `shimbun-headers' method does the first job, the
`shimbun-get-headers' method does the second, the `shimbun-article'
method does the third and the `shimbun-make-contents' method does the
last thing.  The default methods for those categories are defined in
the `shimbun.el' module.

Open the `shimbun.el' file.  You may see unfamiliar definitions like
`luna-define-generic' or `luna-define-method' there.  Hm, they look
like `defun', don't you?  You may also see there's just a doc-string
in the former definition and the same symbol is declared again in the
later form.  And further, there are some symbols only declared by the
`luna-define-generic' form, not by the `luna-define-method' form.
What on earth are we seeing?  Isn't the program not written in the
Emacs-Lisp language?

The truth is that the `shimbun' modules use the `luna.el' module
provided by FLIM which enables you to write object oriented programs
in the Emacs-Lisp language.

There are method programs defined rigidly for the specific purposes in
the `shimbun.el' module.  The `shimbun-headers' method gets a page
source from a certain URL, the `shimbun-get-headers' method gathers
subjects and other informations, etc... (see above).  They do routine
works, so they cannot take proper method to meet various web contents
in the world.  Eh?  Oh, you shouldn't believe in a heresy!

The `shimbun.el' module only provides the default method functions.
Remember the `defadvice' feature.  There are three ways to modify
the behavior of a function: `:before', `:around' and
`:after'.  Similarly, each default `shimbun' method function
can be modified for a certain purpose (note that the `:around'
method-qualifier can be omitted).  And it should be written specially
that the modification will be effective only when the specified
`shimbun' module is selected.

Now as you may have understood that the `luna-define-generic' form
provides only a husk in a sense, the `luna-define-method' form defines
an actual function which can be different for each `shimbun' module,
and the `luna-define-class' form declares the `shimbun' class in the
first part of the `sb-foobar.el' module.



File: emacs-w3m.info, Node: Getting web page and header information, Next: Displaying an article, Prev: Overview, Up: Shimbun Basics

Getting web page and header information
---------------------------------------

Let's identify a target web page URL to gather subjects and other
informations first.  If a web site uses a frame, a target is only one
of the web pages.  Second, lets create a body of the
`shimbun-index-url' method function using the `luna-define-method'
form in your `sb-foobar.el' file.  And make the user customizable
variable `shimbun-foobar-groups', which we will explain later (1)
(*Note Getting web page and header information-Footnotes::).

     (defvar shimbun-foobar-url "http://www.foobar.net")

     (luna-define-method shimbun-index-url ((shimbun shimbun-foobar))
       shimbun-foobar-url)

     (defvar shimbun-foobar-groups '("news"))

After you create a body of the `shimbun-index-url' method, the
`shimbun-headers' method can get a web page source since the
`shimbun.el' module already has the default `shimbun-headers'
method.  After the `shimbun-headers' method gets a web page source,
it calls the `shimbun-get-headers' method to gather headers
information.  As the `shimbun.el' module does not have the
`shimbun-get-headers' method, you have to create it in your
`sb-foobar.el' file.

Now look carefully in the page source and create the
`shimbun-get-headers' method in your `sb-foobar.el' file.

Create a regular expression that can gather headers information.
Minimally necessary information are subject, date, author, URL and
`message-id' of an article.  They are used in MUA as Subject, Date,
From, Xref and Message-ID.

If you want to make an article from a line in a web page source, like:

     <a href="053003.html">some talks on May 30(posted by Mikio &lt;foo@bar.net&gt;)</a>

@noindent

use the following regexp:

     "<a href=\"\\(\\([0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]\\)[0-9][0-9]\\.html\\)\">\\([^<(]+\\)(posted by \\([^<]+\\))<\/a>"

You can get a value for Xref by
`(match-string 1)'.  You can get a value for Date by modifying
a value of
`(match-string 2)'.  Subject by
`(match-string 3)' and From from
`(match-string 4)'.  You can modify them further for showing
additional information in MUA.  See the `sb-muchy.el' file which
makes its original subject form from a web page source.

If URL of an article is a relative path like above, use
`shimbun-expand-url' to expand it before putting information to
header.  If each article doesn't have a each unique URLs (i.e. URL of
headers and URL of articles are just same), you have to ask Emacs to
remember body of an article when gathering headers information, For more
detail see the files `sb-palmfan.el', `sb-dennou.el' and
`sb-tcup.el'.

Sometimes you cannot identify Date information when gathering headers
information only from a web page source.  If so, leave it, just set a
null string, `""' to its value.  If you can identify Date only when
you see contents of an article, you can set it at that time by using
`shimbun-make-contents' method.  And you may use a fixed From for a
web site (e.x. "webmaster@foobar.net").

Be careful when you build a message-id.  Make sure it has uniqueness
otherwise you may not be able to read some articles in the `shimbun'
(2) (*Note Getting web page and header information-Footnotes::).
Assure uniqueness by building message-id using date information, a
domain of the page and/or a part of URL of the page.  And use `@' but
`:' as a part of message-id in order to display inline images.  See
RFC2387 and RFC822 for more detail.

Put these information to header using function
`shimbun-create-header' of the `shimbun.el' module.

A bare bone of `shimbun-get-headers' in your `sb-foobar.el' file is as
follows:

     (luna-define-method shimbun-get-headers ((shimbun shimbun-foobar)
                                              &optional range)
       (let ((regexp "....")
             subject from date id url headers)
         ...
         (catch 'stop
           (while (re-search-forward regexp nil t nil)
             ...
             (when (shimbun-search-id shimbun id)
               (throw 'stop nil))
             (push (shimbun-create-header
                    0 subject from date id "" 0 0 url)
                   headers)))
         headers))

Note that you can access `shimbun-foobar' instance via temporary
variable `shimbun' in the method.

Now we will explain a user variable `shimbun-foobar-groups'.

Assume that you have two groups of articles in
`http://www.foobar.net' and there are two different web pages
for such groups in where `shimbun' module gathers header
information.  For examples, there are what's new information of the web
site in
`http://www.foobar.net/whatsnew/index.hmtl', and there are
archive lists of email messages posted to ML in
`http://www.foobar.net/ml/index.html'.  In such case you may
want to access the group by `shimbun' folders
`foobar.whatsnew' and `foobar.ml'.  If so, put the following S
expressions to the `sb-foobar.el' file.

     (defvar shimbun-foobar-url "http://www.foobar.net")

     (defvar shimbun-foobar-group-path-alist
       '(("whatsnew" . "/whatsnew/index.html")
         ("ml" . "/ml/index.html")))

     (defvar shimbun-foobar-groups
       (mapcar 'car shimbun-foobar-group-path-alist))

     (luna-define-method shimbun-index-url ((shimbun shimbun-foobar))
       (concat shimbun-foobar-url
               (cdr (assoc (shimbun-current-group-internal shimbun)
                           shimbun-foobar-group-path-alist))))

You can get the current group by using
`shimbun-current-group-internal'.  You can use it in
`shimbun-get-headers' method (or others) in order to change its
behavior in accordance with the current group.

Each `shimbun' module needs at least one group.  There is not a
special rule for naming a group, but if you don't find out a good
name, use `news' or `main'.


File: emacs-w3m.info  Node: Getting web page and header information-Footnotes, Up: Getting web page and header information

(1) At least one group is necessary for each `shimbun' module
even if you don't want it.

(2) And more, you may not be able to read actual email messages from
someone when message-ids conflict!



File: emacs-w3m.info, Node: Displaying an article, Next: Inheriting shimbun module, Prev: Getting web page and header information, Up: Shimbun Basics

Displaying an article
---------------------

`shimbun-article' method defined in the `shimbun.el' module gets URL
from Xref information of header, get a web page source from the URL,
and call `shimbun-make-contents' in working buffer of the source.
Major job of `shimbun-make-contents' is to process such HTML.  Imagine
that a working buffer has a web page source of an article.
`shimbun-make-contents' defined in the `shimbun.el' module insert (i)
header information to top of the buffer, (ii) `<html>', `<body>' and
etc. right after the information, and (iii) `</body>' and `</html>' to
end of the buffer.  MUA displays an article as a HTML mail.

If you don't want to process an article, you don't have to define
`shimbun-make-contents' in the `sb-foobar.el' module.

If you want to remove some part of a web page source of an article at
its top and its end, set regexp to `shimbun-foobar-content-start' that
matches content start and `shimbun-foobar-content-end' that matches
content end.

     (defvar shimbun-foobar-content-start "^<body>$")
     (defvar shimbun-foobar-content-end "^<\/body>$")

`shimbun-clear-contents', which is called by `shimbun-make-contents'
defined in the `shimbun.el' module, will remove HTML source from
`point-min' to `shimbun-foobar-content-start' and from
`shimbun-foobar-content-end' to `point-max' using the regexps.  Note
that it will not remove any HTML source when either of the regexp
searches fails.

If you want to remove more unnecessary parts (e.x. advertisements)
diligently, define `shimbun-clear-contents' in your new
`sb-foobar.el' file as follows:

     (luna-define-method shimbun-clear-contents :around ((shimbun shimbun-foobar)
                                                         header)
       ;; cleaning up
       (while (re-search-forward "..." nil t nil)
         (delete-region (match-beginning 0) (match-end 0)))
       (luna-call-next-method))

For more details see `shimbun-make-contents' in the
`sb-ibm-dev.el' file.

I said in the subsection of *Note Getting web page and header information:: that if each article doesn't have a each unique URLs you
have to ask Emacs to remember body of an article when gathering headers
information,  In such case you don't have to get a web page from URL of
Xref in `shimbun-article' method.  Just get texts from Emacs

Inheriting shimbun module
-------------------------

There are some famous mailing list manager (or archiver).

   * Mailman
     The GNU Mailing List Manager, formerly called as `pipermail'.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/index.html' for detail.

   * MHonArc See `http://www.oac.uci.edu/indiv/ehood/mhonarc.html' for
     detail.

   * fml
     fml mailing list server/manager.  See
     `http://www.fml.org/software/fml/' for detail.

   * mailarc See `http://cvs.namazu.org/mailarc/' for detail.

If you find out one of such mailing list managers' names in a web page
source when you analyze it in the step of *Note Getting web page and
header information::, you are very lucky (1) (*Note Inheriting shimbun
module-Footnotes::).  The modules `sb-mailman.el',
`sb-mhonarc.el', `sb-fml.el' and `sb-mailarc.el' have
the `shimbun-get-headers' method, etc, already, when you write
small code that is not defined in such `shimbun' modules, your
new `sb-foobar.el' module works!

If you use the `sb-mailman.el' module, write the following S
expressions to the top of the `sb-foobar.el' file:

     (require 'shimbun)
     (require 'sb-mailman)
     (luna-define-class shimbun-foobar (shimbun-mailman) ())

Those above mean that `shimbun' module `shimbun-foobar' inherits
shimbun-mailman class (2) (*Note Inheriting shimbun
module-Footnotes::) and methods defined in the `sb-mailman.el' module
will be used in `shimbun-foobar' by default.  You can overwrite some
of parent methods, if necessary.

See the `sb-pilot-mailsync.el' file as a sample that uses the
`sb-mailman.el' module.  You can feel how easy to create a new
`shimbun' module by using such parent modules.

Note that there are some localized version of such mailing list
manager, for examples, some of them show Date information in Japanese.
The modules `sb-mailman.el', `sb-mhonarc.el', `sb-fml.el' and
`sb-mailarc.el' assumes that mailing list managers are not localized.

If you want to read via `shimbun' a web site that uses localized
mailing list manager, you may have to overwrite some methods in the
parent module.

(1) Such mailing list managers often show their own name in an archive
list page

(2) i.e. shimbun-mailman class is a parent class.

Coding convention of Shimbun
----------------------------

   * You can use all functions defined in emacs-w3m in `shimbun.el'.

   * You can use no functions defined in emacs-w3m in `sb-*.el'.  If
     you want to use emacs-w3m functions in `sb-*.el', you must add
     their stubs to `shimbun.el'.

   * You must avoid file names that have already used in SpeedBar.
     Here is a list of file names used in `speedbar-0.14beta4'.

     sb-ant.el     sb-html.el    sb-info.el    sb-texinfo.el
     sb-gud.el     sb-image.el   sb-rmail.el   sb-w3.el

   * You should select file names which remind their refering WEB
     servers' URIs.  It is allowed to remove coutry parts
     (Ex. jp,de,uk,etc), organization parts (Ex. edu,com,org,net,etc)
     and redundant parts (Ex. www) if removing does not increase
     vagueness.

   * You should select group names in USENET style.  It means that
     small characters are preferred in group names, and that period(.)
     is preferred as an delimiter to show hierarchical structure in
     groups.

Some knick-knacks using emacs-w3m
*********************************

Here are some handy tips to use emacs-w3m with other Emacs facilities.

   * browse-url

     You can use emacs-w3m with the `browse-url' feature.  For
     instance, put the following lines in your `~/.emacs' file:

          (setq browse-url-browser-function 'w3m-browse-url)
          (global-set-key "\C-xm" 'browse-url-at-point)

     Emacs-w3m will now be invoked when you type the `C-x m' key on a
     string which looks like a URL in any Emacs buffer.  In addition, you can
     use emacs-w3m to preview an HTML file that you are just editing by
     typing the `C-c C-v' key (note that you need to use Emacs and the
     `html-mode' major mode to edit the HTML file).

     If you'd like to use another web browser than emacs-w3m when
     using the `C-x m' key when you are in an emacs-w3m buffer (who
     wants to do so?), add the following advice to `~/.emacs' file:

          (defadvice browse-url-at-point
            (around change-browse-url-browser-function activate)
            "Use Netscape only when it is invoked in an emacs-w3m buffer."
            (let ((browse-url-browser-function
                   (if (eq major-mode 'w3m-mode)
                       'browse-url-netscape
                     'w3m-browse-url)))
              ad-do-it))

   * dired

     You can use emacs-w3m to browse an HTML file in a `dired' buffer by
     typing the `C-x m' key.  Use the following settings in your
     `~/.emacs' file:

          (eval-after-load "dired"
            '(define-key dired-mode-map "\C-xm" 'dired-w3m-find-file))

          (defun dired-w3m-find-file ()
            (interactive)
            (require 'w3m)
            (let ((file (dired-get-filename)))
              (if (y-or-n-p (format "Use emacs-w3m to browse %s? "
                                    (file-name-nondirectory file)))
                  (w3m-find-file file))))

   * hnf-mode

     You can see the newest diary using emacs-w3m and the hyper nikki system.
     Put the following lines in your `~/.emacs' file and type the
     `C-c C-b' key in an `hnf-mode' buffer:

          (defun w3m-hnf-browse-url-w3m (url &optional new-window)
            (interactive (browse-url-interactive-arg "URL: "))
            (save-selected-window
              (pop-to-buffer (get-buffer-create "*w3m*"))
              (w3m-browse-url url new-window)))
          (setq hnf-browse-url-browser-function #'w3m-hnf-browse-url-w3m)

   * Gnus

     You've mistaken the entrance if you are a Gnus user and this
     section is the first page you read in this Info.  See *Note
     Hooking into MUAs:: first.

     By default, Gnus will not apply the treatment variables, for
     instance `gnus-treat-strip-banner', to `text/html' parts.  To
     have them applied to `text/html' parts automatically, there are
     two ways to do that:

          ;; Apply all the treatments to text/html parts.
          (eval-after-load "gnus-art"
            '(add-to-list 'gnus-article-treat-types "text/html"))

          ;; Apply a certain treatment to text/html parts.
          (setq gnus-treat-strip-banner '(or t (typep "text/html")))

     Also *Note Customizing Articles: (gnus)Customizing Articles, for
     details.

     In addition, the experimental code below is used to display
     `multipart/related' pictures.  The place might be something wrong.

          (eval-after-load "gnus-art"
            '(or (assoc "multipart/related" gnus-mime-multipart-functions)
                 (setq gnus-mime-multipart-functions
                       (cons
                        (cons
                         "multipart/related"
                         (byte-compile
                          (lambda (handle)
                            (gnus-mime-display-mixed (cdr handle)))))
                        gnus-mime-multipart-functions))))

   * yahtml-mode

     You can use emacs-w3m to preview an HTML file that just you are
     editing with the `yahtml-mode'.  Here is an example:

          (defadvice yahtml-browse-html
            (around w3m-yahtml-browse-html activate compile)
            (w3m-goto-url (ad-get-arg 0) t))

   * jisx0213

     You can use JIS X 0213 character set in Emacs using the `jis0213'
     module which is bundled in the Mule-UCS package.  Although the
     `decode-char' function in Emacs 21 and later is overridden by
     `mucs' (`jis0213' loads `mucs') and it stops working
     properly for the `ucs' coded character set, it has been reported
     that also to load the `unicode' module seems to solve the problem.
     The reason has not been made clear yet.  Here is an example for the
     `~/.emacs' file:

          (require 'unicode)
          (require 'un-define)
          (require 'jisx0213)

Companion packages you might need
*********************************

Even though emacs-w3m provides a wealth of features, you may want to
check out the following external packages for even more usability:

   * w3m-session.el

     The w3m-session.el package provides persistent emacs-w3m browsing
     sessions.  When quitting emacs-w3m you can save the current
     session (that is, the set of open tabs and the URLs they're
     visiting).  Upon restarting emacs-w3m you'll have the possibility
     of recovering the saved session.

     Download w3m-session.el from
     `http://www.emacswiki.org/elisp/wthreem-session.el'.

   * w3m-type-ahead.el

     The w3m-type-ahead.el package provides "type ahead" searching,
     similar to the feature by the same name from Mozilla browsers.
     It allows you to find anchors using an interface similar to
     isearch, but results are limited to anchors in the buffer.

     Download w3m-type-ahead.el from
     `http://alioth.debian.org/project/showfiles.php?group_id=30594'.
